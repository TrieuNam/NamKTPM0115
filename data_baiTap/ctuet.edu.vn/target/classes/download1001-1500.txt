AB The occurrence of multiple holes in wireless sensor networks poses many challenges in designing routing protocols. The traditional scheme is forwarding packets along the hole perimeters. However, this scheme leads to two serious problems: data concentration around the hole boundaries and routing path enlargement. Recently, several approaches have been proposed to address these two problems, wherein a common idea is to form forbidden areas around the holes from which packets are kept to stay away. However, due to the static nature of the forbidden areas and routing paths, the existing protocols cannot solve these two problems thoroughly. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol for bypassing multiple holes in wireless sensor networks which can balance the traffic over the network while ensuring the constant stretch property of the routing path. Our main idea is to use elastic forbidden areas and dynamic routing paths. The theoretical analysis proves that the routing path stretch of the proposed protocol can be controlled to be as small as 1 + epsilon (for any predefined epsilon > 0), and the simulation experiments show that our protocol strongly outperforms state-of-the-art protocols in terms of load balancing.

AB In this paper, we propose intuitionistic linguistic vector (ILV) as a tuple of intuitionistic linguistic numbers (ILNs). ILV can describe information which involves multiple linguistic terms according to different intuitionistic fuzzy values. Similarity measures for ILNs and ILVs are also given. The novel concepts are used to construct a classification algorithm (Intuitionistic Fuzzy Linguistic Vector Similarity Measure based Classification Algorithm, IFLVS). The performance of proposed algorithm is validated by experiments.

AB In the past few years, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been increasingly gaining impact in the real world with with various applications such as healthcare, condition monitoring, control networks, etc. Anomaly detection in WSNs is an important aspect of data analysis in order to identify data items which does not conform to an expected pattern or other items in a dataset. This paper describes a anomaly detection method using support vector data description (SVDD) kernelized by Mahalanobis distance with adjusted discriminant threshold. The efficiency of this method is studied over a real data set. Numerical result demonstrates that the proposed approach achieved a high-level of detection accuracy and a low percentage of false alarm rate owing to wise choices of discriminant threshold.

AB Biological molecules (e.g. DNAs, RNs, proteins, etc.) do not function in isolation themselves but in a sophisticated manner of various interactions between them to carry out every biological processes in living cells. Data about these interactions are exponentially increased thanks to advanced technologies. Analyzing biological interaction networks is essential to get insights into how biological system works. Among analytics tasks querying a small network of interest against a well studied large-scale one is regarded as one of the most essential task and is proven to be a NP-complete problem. This paper presents an efficient biological network querying method called APPRB, which is an improvement of the state-of-the-art biological network queyring method APPAGATO introduced in 2016 by taking advantages of FASTAn, an PPI alignment algorithm. Experimental results showed that our algorithm performed much better than the original APPAGATO. With these results, we hope that our proposed method APP-RB will be helpful to biologists and those who are interested in network comparison problems.

AB Extending from limited domain to a new domain is crucial for Natural Language Generation in Dialogue, especially when there are sufficient annotated data in the source domain, but there is little labeled data in the target domain. This paper studies the performance and domain adaptation of two different Neural Network Language Generators in Spoken Dialogue Systems: a gating-based Recurrent Neural Network Generator and an extension of an Attentional Encoder-Decoder Generator. We found in model fine-tuning scenario that by separating slot and value parameterizations, the attention-based generators, in comparison to the gating-based generators, show ability to not only prevent semantic repetition in generated outputs and obtain better performance across all domains, but also adapt faster to a new, unseen domain by leveraging existing data. The empirical results show that the attention-based generator can adapt to an open domain when only a limited amount of target domain data is available.

AB Radio energy harvesting model is an another method to extend the lifetime of wireless networks. In this paper, an energy harvesting model is given for amply-and-forward relay networks with aiding of ambient interferences. For this reason, the energy constrained relays harvest energy from the received signal and then use that harvested energy to amply and send that signal to the target. A time switching regime is also investigated at the same time. Finally, we consider the outage probability and throughput performances for full-duplex mode in one-way energy harvesting relay networks. The gotten results show that the impact of loop interference, the position of the relay as well as the energy conversion factor on their performance and improve that the delay-limited mode is better than that of the delay-tolerant one.

AB In this paper, two methods to improve the secrecy of cooperative transmissions using unshared jamming are investigated in which only the source and destination nodes know the jamming signals. The jamming signals are based on unique cipher keys obtained on the high layers. In the first proposed method (SJ protocol), a source combines its secrecy signal with its jamming signal using the power allocation strategy before broadcasting to the relay, destination and even eavesdropper nodes. In the second proposed method (DJ protocol), a source transmits its secrecy signal at the same time a destination transmits its jamming signal. For the secrecy performance evaluation, the asymptotic secrecy outage probability of the end-to-end achievable secrecy rate over flat and block Rayleigh fading channels are studied. Monte-Carlo results are presented to verify the theoretical analyses.

AB Updated nonlinearity models for solid-state power amplifiers (SSPAs) include both amplitude and phase distortions, and thus being the same as nonlinearities in traveling-wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs), resulting in detrimental effects for multiple-input multiple-output space-time block code (MIMO-STBC) systems with nonlinear amplifications. This work presents a thorough investigation for the performance of a non-parametric phase estimation method for receive signal in such systems with different nonlinearities incurred from several types of HPAs. Numerical simulations verify the relevance of theoretical arguments and efficiency of the proposed estimation scheme.

ID RANDOM ORACLES
AB To deal with the problem of large certificate in Public Key Infrastructure, several techniques have been introduced such as Identity-based cryptography, Implicit certificate, Password-based cryptography and recently Certificateless cryptography at Asiacrypt'03. In a certificateless system, only user with her full private key can decrypt the ciphertext while the authority with her master key cannot. Moreover, there is no need to use the certificate to certify the public key of user.
   Certificateless public key encryption schemes in the standard model have been proposed in many works. In this paper, we continue this line of research by proposing a new one. When comparing with other certificateless public key encryption schemes in the standard model, our scheme is the best one to date in term of efficiency. However, our scheme only achieves a weak level of security that is the weak selective chosen plaintext Type I adversary under the well-known q-BDHI assumption, and the selective chosen plaintext Type II adversary under a new simple static assumption.

AB This paper considers the multi-unit resource allocation problem with a few distinct (indivisible and non-shareable) goods (or items, objects), each has a certain amount of copies. Every agent expresses her preference over multisets of goods by mean of utility function. The goal is to distribute goods among agents in such a way that maximizes either utilitarian social welfare or egalitarian social welfare or Nash product. Mathematically, such a problem can be formulated as an integer programming with linear constraints. We explore some special structure of this problem which facilitates the development of efficient (exact or approximation) algorithms. In addition, we concern with various types of utility functions, ranging from multi-minded functions, additive functions, submodular functions, to general functions.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel contents verification method using the distributed redundant image storages and user-based reconstruction algorithm. There are two processes composing in our proposal such as the image dispersion method and the image reconstruction method. In the image dispersion method, the images are dispersed into many information patches and are stored on the distributed storages, e.g Dropbox, Google Drive, ... Since the size of information patches is smaller than the full-size of image, the information patches can be distributed on cloud storages via network. Therefore, the resource of cloud storages is used effectively. On the other hand, in the image reconstruction method, the information patches of the image can be collected in order to reconstruct the image for user. The key point of idea in the image reconstruction method is that the reconstructed images should be distinguished each others and the producer can detect the user that it belongs to. The algorithm of reconstruction method employs the watermarking method to generate the watermark pattern based on the user's information such as license number. The demonstration results of our proposed method show that our system can be used as the contents verification in the digital contents distribution system.

AB Recognition of human actions is an intelligent way for human-machine communication and Radial basis function (RBF) models are among the most powerful machines on this task. One prerequisite of using this traditional model is that the movement data must be translated into a vector space via the feature extraction process. Recent development of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been shown that this deep architecture could achieve state-of-the-art performance in different recognition tasks. However, it is not possible to apply the CNN directly to many applications like 3D coordinates of human skeletal joints. In this paper, we present an effective way of reorganizing the 3D skeletal joints into feature maps, which enables applying the modern CNNs to recognize human gestures. Experimental results on the Microsoft's Kinect dataset MSRC-12 show that the proposed data re-organization scheme combined with the deep feature learning of CNN could achieve very competitive predictive accuracy.

AB Mining high utility patterns, the subject of which has attracted many researchers in data mining, is the process of discovering patterns with utility satisfying a minimum predetermined threshold. Many studies have been performed, but finding the suitable minimum utility threshold is problematic, because users cannot predict the appropriate threshold that affects mining performance. To solve this problem, mining the highest utility of k patterns, called top-k high utility, has been proposed. Although many approaches have been proposed, the issue of many candidates and the performance of mining needed to be further studied. In this paper, we propose a top-k high utility mining method that does not produce a candidate with an effective threshold-raising strategy. Instead, the proposed method uses a utility-list data structure with improved threshold-raising strategies combined with an efficient pruning strategy. Experimental results on real and synthesis datasets show that the algorithm presented performs better than current methods.

AB Educational data mining has received much attention worldwide due to its significance in the education domain. Among a large number of the educational data mining tasks, early in-trouble student prediction is a popular one. This task focuses on identifying the students who are at risk in their study as soon as possible before the end of the permitted period of study time. For early detection, data shortage is a challenge for the task at both instance and set levels. Indeed, at the instance level, incomplete data could be gathered for each student at his/her early study period and also at the set level, many labeled data could not be collected for their final study status. Therefore, a solution to the task in such a context is required. In this paper, we propose a robust random forest-based Tri-training algorithm that can overcome that data shortage challenge. In particular, based on the semi-supervised learning process of the original Tri-training algorithm, an incomplete data handling method is integrated into its iterative mechanism so that the Tri-training algorithm can be more robust. In addition, a new combination of the Tri-training algorithm and a random forest model is examined so that each classifier of the Tri-training model can be enhanced for more accurate predictions. As a result, the proposed algorithm is an effective solution to the early in-trouble student prediction task. Its effectiveness has been confirmed with the better experimental results on real data sets in comparison with the existing methods using the preprocessing approach.

AB Extracting and recognizing mathematical expressions of scientific documents are key steps in the process of mathematical retrieval system, where the documents contain different components such as text, tables, figures, and mathematical expressions. There are several methods proposed to handle the components of documents. Those methods have investigated the feature of components based on the segmented text lines. This paper proposes a new method to detect mathematical presentation in the form of displayed expression from scientific documents using Fast Fourier Transformation. The test for the proposed method shows that the accuracy is from 94% to 98% for recognizing mathematical expressions on the benchmark datasets. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in compared with the other ones.

ID LOCAL BINARY PATTERNS; FACE-RECOGNITION
AB Gender is one of the most useful facial attributes which are detected from human face images. In this work, we introduce a new gender classification system based on features extracted by Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) operators from intensity and Monogenic images. More detailed, the LPQ features are obtained from the input image (the intensity one) and from three other Monogenic components in the feature extraction stage. In the classification stage, we employ the binary SVM classifier to predict the gender of the given test images. The comparisons among our experimental results upon two public databases, LFW and Groups dataset, and those of other systems show that the proposed system is comparable with state-of-the-art approaches when it attains competing accuracy rates (97.0% on LFW and 91.58% upon Groups dataset).

ID ALOHA
AB This work investigates the anonymous tag cardinality estimation problem in radio frequency identification systems with frame slotted aloha-based protocol. Each tag, instead of sending its identity upon receiving the reader's request, randomly responds by only one bit in one of the time slots of the frame due to privacy and security. As a result, each slot with no response is observed as in an empty state, while the others are non-empty. Those information can be used for the tag cardinality estimation. Nevertheless, under effects of fading and noise, time slots with tags' response might be observed as empty, while those with no response might be detected as non-empty, which is known as a false detection phenomenon. The performance of conventional estimation methods is, thus, degraded because of inaccurate observations. In order to cope with this issue, we propose a new estimation algorithm using expectation-maximization method. Both the tag cardinality and a probability of false detection are iteratively estimated to maximize a likelihood function. Computer simulations will be provided to show the merit of the proposed method.

AB Attribute-specific models are quite effective in the detection of web attacks. Nevertheless, none of existing attribute-specific models can be applied directly to modern web applications, which are dominant today and which use RESTful URLs. The barrier is that paths and parameters are mixed in URLs so that detection systems cannot identify which programs and attributes are which. To remove this barrier, this paper is the first one dealing with the identification of paths and parameters in RESTful URLs. The problem is raised, then a simple yet effective method to solve the problem is proposed. We validate our method via experiments.

ID ATMOSPHERIC-TURBULENCE CHANNELS; DESIGN
AB In this paper, we propose a high-altitude platform (HAP)-based free space optical communication (FSO) system using all-optical relaying to connect two ground stations (GSs) via a HAP. Optical detect-amplify-and-forward is carried out at the HAP thanks to the use of an optical hard-limiter and an optical amplifier. In addition, coherent detection is applied at the GS's receiver to improved the receiver sensitivity. The closed-form expression for the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed FSO system is deduced assuming that the atmospheric channel is modeled as Gamma-Gamma distribution. The achievable BER with low values has proved the feasibility of our proposed system. In addition, the advantage of using coherent detection compared to the direct detection is demonstrated in term of power gain. Other useful information for system design regarding the required transmitted power, the local oscillator power, and the optimum threshold power is also provided in this paper.

AB We have witnessed the exponential growth of 3D GIS applications which vary from 3D urban management, a heritage city, archaeology, flood controlling, planning and designing, and government planning, to name a few. Thanks to the diversity of 3D models that are used to represent objects in reality and spatial database systems that are utilized to store spatial data, designers and developers can explore and exploit their ability and imagine ultimately to create fantastic applications. Nevertheless, due to this diversity and variousness, it is not easy to decide which 3D model suits to which application. In order to overcome this challenge, this paper introduces a brief comparative survey on 3D GIS data models as a look-up material. Most of the popular 3D GIS models are roll-called and compared on different criteria depending on their spatial properties.

AB In recent years there have been many proposals for automated applications in vegetable harvesting. There are two major challenges: estimation of yield and harvesting of fruit trees. This research proposes a new algorithm that allows accurate counting of the number of fruits on a tree to accurately estimate the output of a dragon fruit. The algorithm consists of the following main steps: image segmentation, boundary determination, shape analysis, and overlap analysis to count the number of dragon fruits per tree. Experimental results show that the algorithm can solve the problem of counting the correct number of fruits per tree to accurately estimate the yield of dragon fruit in the farm.

AB In this paper, we revisit multi-party Diffie-Hellman key exchange (DHKE) protocols by using multi-linear mappings and Weil pairings over elliptic curves. We show how to construct a 4-linear Weil pairing and illustrate the approach by examples. Finally, we present several necessary conditions to find a distortion map for a 5-party DHKE protocol.

AB This article studies the complex staff rescheduling problem arising in the context of Lai Chau hydropower station. Currently, rescheduling task is implemented manually by agreement of switching shifts among workers or by a scheduler. It is a complex and time-consuming operation but obtained schedules have been far below the expectation of the staff as they in general violate working rules and contract agreements. In this research, we propose an approach based on Mixed Integer Programming to support the scheduler solving the problem. Our model includes multiple objectives which minimize the number of changed shifts and the number of affected employees. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.

ID FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS
AB Many practical networks can be mathematically modeled as graphs. Graph signal processing (GSP), intersecting graph theory and computational harmonic analysis, can be used to analyze graph signals. Just as short-time Fourier transform (STFT) for time-frequency analysis in classical signal processing, we have windowed graph Fourier transform (WGFT) for vertex-frequency analysis in GSP. In this paper, we introduced a new graph modulation operator that satisfies the property of spectral conservation, and a new graph translation operator with interesting properties. Based on these operators, we presented a new method to obtain the WGFT with a tight vertex-frequency frame. These GSP tools were developed based on the graph adjacency matrix. Using time-series graph, USA graph and random graph as examples, we showed by simulation the advantages of our proposed GSP tools over the state-of-the-arts.

AB In this research, we propose a heterogeneous anomaly-based intrusion detection system (HA-IDS) which is built on both of Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) platforms. An essential anomaly-based IDS comprises of the two main components: Feature Construction Module (FC) to extract and collect network header information, and Classification Module (CM) to categorize connections' behaviors. In our proposed system, FC is implemented on FPGA to handle large-scale data while CM is deployed on GPU using Back-propagation Neuron Network to utilize the parallel computing for improving the system performance. We employ our proposed system on GPU - GIGABYTE GeForce GTX 1080 and FPGA - Xilinx Virtex-5 XC5VTX240T chip. The experiment result shows that the training outcome on GPU is faster than that on CPU by up to 12x. The testing system throughput in real-time is 200Mbps with more than 80% in Accuracy Rate. This work proves that this is promising to take advantages of these two platforms to apply to a particular issue.

AB We present the two-stage optical phase conjugation (OPC) to compensate both dispersion and Kerr nonlinearities in a long-haul 4x56 Gbit/s RZ-DQPSK DWDM transmission system. The two-stage OPC is realized to reduce the amount of unwanted products that are produced through nonlinear mixing processes in third-order nonlinear media. We have investigated the benefit of the two-stage OPC using highly nonlinear fiber (HNLF) and chalcogenide As2S3 waveguide for comparison. We have shown that the performance of the two-stage OPC is significantly improved only in HNLF.

AB Spectrum sharing environment permits secondary users (SUs) to utilize radio spectrum of primary users (PUs) but creates cross-interference between SUs and PUs. Moreover, jamming signal is useful in improving information security by deliberately corrupting received signals at eavesdroppers. The current paper presents an analytical framework on communication reliability and information security, which takes into account jamming signal, primary interference, maximum transmit power constraint, interference power constraint, Rayleigh fading. The analytical framework includes two exact closed-form formulas of detection outage probability and interception outage probability. Its validity is corroborated by computer simulations. Various results illustrate that the primary interference dramatically deteriorates both probabilities while the jamming signal creates their large difference, highlighting its efficacy in enhancing information security.

DE FPGA; Floating point Gaussian filtering; Scalable; Hardware architecture
AB With the fast increasingly use of image and video processing in many aspects, the requirements for high performance and high-quality systems lead to the use of reconfigurable computing to accelerate traditional image processing platforms. In this work, an efficient runtime adaptable floating-point Gaussian filtering core is proposed to achieve not only high performance and quality but also kernel runtime adaptability. The architecture allows both filtering kernel size and values to be redefined on-the-fly. Moreover, the core can process up to one pixel per cycle with a 1D Gaussian filtering. The core is developed with Verilog-HDL and can be built on various FPGA families. Experimental results with multiple images at different resolutions show that the core is able to perform a 2D Gaussian filtering for 48 1080 x 1920-pixel or 313 512 x 512-pixel images per second with an 11 x 11 floating-point kernel.

AB This paper presents the design of a Coarse-grained Reconfigurable Architecture (CGRA), called MUSRA (Multimedia Specific Reconfigurable Architecture). The MUSRA is proposed to exploit multi-level parallelism of the computation-intensive loops in multimedia processing applications. To solve the huge bandwidth requirement of parallel processing arrays, the proposed architecture focuses on the exploitation of data locality to reduce data access bandwidth and increase efficiency of pipelined execution of the kernel loops. The MUSRA also supports the capability of dynamic reconfiguration by enabling the hardware fabrics to be reconfigured into different functions even if the system is working. The proposed architecture has been modeled at Register Transfer Level (RTL) by using VHDL language. Some benchmark applications have been mapped onto the MUSRA in order to validate the high flexibility and performance of the architecture that is suitable for a wide range of multimedia processing applications. The proposed CGRA can be applied as a reconfigurable hardware IP (Intellectual Property) core in reconfigurable high-performance System-on-Chips.

AB In residential houses, air conditioners consume a lot of electrical energy. In order to improve energy efficiency for residential houses, short-term prediction of energy consumption of air conditioners is required. In this paper, we propose the use of our thermal simulation to simulate the change of room temperature based on weather forecast information and predict the energy consumption of an air conditioner in a residential house. In order to calculate solar radiation heat flux, which contributes a lot to the change of room temperature, we utilize a neural network model to predict global solar radiation using training data obtained from weather stations. We also utilize a PID control model to simulate the operation of air conditioners. The accuracy of our simulation is verified by experiments carried out at a real testbed house.

AB Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) is a popular feature description for the purpose of object detection. However, HOG algorithm requires a high performance system because of its complex operation set. In HOG algorithm, the cell histogram generation is one of the most complex part, it uses inverse tangent, square, square root, floating point multiplication. In this paper, we propose an accurate and low complex cell histogram generation by bypass the gradient of pixel computation. It employs the bin's boundary angle method to determine the two quantized angles. However, instead of choosing an approximate value of tan, the nearest greater and the nearest smaller of each tan value from the ratios between pixel's derivative in y and x direction are used. The magnitudes of two bins are the solutions of a system of two equations, which represents the equality of the gradient of a pixel and its two bins in both vertical and horizontal direction. The proposed method spends only 30 addition and 40 shift operations to caculate two bins of a pixel. Simulation results show that the percentage of error when reconstructing the differences in x and y direction are always less than 2% with 8-bit length of the fractional part. Additionally, manipulating the precision of gradient magnitude is very simple by pre-defined sine and cosine values of quantized angles. The synthesis results of a hardware implementation of the proposed method occupy 3.57 KGEs in 45nm NanGate standard cell library. The hardware module runs at the maximum frequency of 400 MHz, and the throughput is 0.4 pixel/ns for a single module. It is able to support 48 fps with 4 K UHD resolution.

AB We present a model-based testing approach for reactive systems where both test inputs and expected results are generated from 'restricted' Event-B specifications. We show that it is possible to automatically build the restricted Event-B specifications from the original ones base on a knowledge base of the system under tests. The restricted models are to reduce the state space of the original Event-B models while preserving the possible testing paths, so that our model-based generated test suite can archive equivalent path coverage as using the original models. We also present a tool and a testing skeleton that are easy to use so that system developers can effectively test an arbitrary number of scenarios with reactive systems.

AB The paper presents the design and processing-time evaluation of an embedded system with the purpose for forensic image detection based on the multi-resolution based algorithm. After the success of the proposed method we then successfully implement on the newest version of the hardware Raspberry Pi-3B which is currently a low cost and friendly environment for variously specific-research applications. The processing times for identifying fake images are compared through different platforms and CPUs of the investigated systems. The results have shown that the processing times depends not only on the dimension and the quality of fake images but also the platform and software facility of the evaluated systems (i.e. on PC-based simulations and Raspberry Pi-based embedded systems).

AB Model-based software estimation uses algorithms and past project data to make predictions for new projects. This paper presents a comparative assessment of four modeling approaches, including the original COCOMO, COCOMO calibration, k-Nearest Neighbors, and a combination of COCOMO calibration and k-Nearest Neighbors. Our results indicate that using kNN to select the nearest projects and calibrating them produce favorable estimation accuracy. The best estimates can be produced using a small number of nearest neighboring projects to calibrate. We recommend that organizations use between 8 and 10 nearest projects to calibrate the COCOMO model.

AB Paralleling source code is the most common approach to optimize the performance of Android applications on multi-core processors. However, the problem of selecting a good parallel structure and its parameter tube is still a challenge. This paper proposes the performance optimization method based on selecting the best parallel configuration including the parallel structure and corresponding parameter tube. Native C/C++ code of an Android application is analyzed to find parallel structures using OpenMP framework and parameter tubes of each parallel structure. The evaluation function is built to evaluate the performance of an Android application under parallel configuration. This function is implemented in an optimization program to select the best parallel configuration of the Android application.

DE real-time components; correctness-by-construction; self-adaptive system;
   self-integrated systems; real-time software model
AB Design by contract and relational interface theories are powerful for specifying component-based systems. We extend these theories with real-time properties so that our technique can model component-based real-time systems. In addition, we use linear temporal logic (LTL) for specifying the invariant properties of contracts. To specify the interaction between methods in a component, and the interaction between components, we use the timed regular expressions over a distributed alphabet. The correctness of a system model is based on the correctness by construction approach. We show several examples that our technique is powerful and useful to guarantee the correctness of component-based systems with real-time requirements.

DE Link prediction; Weight prediction; Data mining
AB In data mining, link prediction for the networks is one of the areas of greatest interest today. Research achievements of link prediction problem can be applied in many fields such as study genetically transferred diseases, online marketing, e-commerce services, discover the structure of criminal networks, friend request in social networks ... However, most of researchers focused on predicting the existence of links in previous studies of link prediction. The predicting weight of links has not been heavily researched. In this paper, we introduce an effective solution for weighted network. We propose a novel learning-based approach to weight prediction. Our approach presents the Topological Similarity Score (TSS) feature combined by six indices (CN, AA, RA, rWCN, rWAA, rWRA) to compute the similarity scores between nodes. We propose to utilize Support Vector Regression (SVR) with TSS feature to predict weights. All experiments were conducted on five data sets: Cel, USAir, Lesmis, ReHall, Netscience. Experimental results show that our approach can increase the weight prediction correlation coefficient by 70% over and reduce the error by 17%, compared to the baseline approach.

AB Various problems in biomedicine can be formulated as a ranking problem, where a set of candidate components is ranked relatively based on a set of known components. The most popular problem in biomedicine is identification of disease-associated cellular components, where cellular components can be genes, proteins, microRNAs or other molecules. Besides that, a number of problems in pharmacology is also similar such as identification of drug-target interactions and prediction of novel drug-disease associations. They are all considered as ranking problems. Many computational methods have been proposed to these problems including machine learning-based and network-based ones. In which, machine learning-based methods usually approach those as binary classification problems, where an unknown association/interaction is predicted as "associate/interact" or "not associate/interact". However, as abovementioned, those problems should be formulated as ranking problems since it is often in biomedicine and pharmacology that not observed association/interaction does not mean it does not exist. Meanwhile, network-based methods have been naturally approached those problems by ranking candidate associations/interactions relatively to a set of known ones. Among network-based methods, random walk with restart (RWR), a network propagation algorithm, has shown to be state-of-the-art one for those problems. Therefore, in this study, we are going to review usage of this algorithm for a number of problems in biomedicine and pharmacology.

AB Building ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) with the minimum number of recombination events is an essential problem in genomic population studies. Exhaustive search methods have been proposed to solve the problem with few sequences and markers. Recently, we introduced ARG4WG algorithm [1] to build plausible ARGs for whole genomes of thousand samples. However, the ARG4WG algorithm was not designed to optimize the number of recombination events. In this work, we propose a new design of the ARG4WG algorithm to optimize the number of recombination events. The key idea is to analyze and combine different criteria (i.e., the longest shared ends, the maximum similarity between sequences, and the length of sequences) to select the best candidates for recombinations. The experiments on different data sets showed that our new algorithms produced ARGs with smaller number of recombination events in comparison to other methods. The methods allow us to build minimum recombination ARGs from whole genome data sets.

AB In this work, we propose an efficient architecture for the hardware realization of deep neural networks on reconfigurable computing platforms like FPGA. The proposed neural network architecture employs only one single physical computing layer to perform the whole computational fabric of fully-connected feedforward deep neural networks with customizable number of layers, number of neurons per layer and number of inputs. The inputs, weights and outputs of the network are represented in 16-bit half-precision floating-point number format. The network weights are hard-coded using on-chip memory of FPGA devices, allowing for very fast computation. For performance evaluation, the handwritten digit recognition application with MNIST database is performed, which reported a recognition rate of 97.20% and a peak performance of 15.81 kFPS when using a deep neural network of size 784-40-40-10 on the Xilinx Virtex-5 XC5VLX-110T device. When implementing a deep neural network of size 784-126-126-10 for MNIST database on the Xilinx ZynQ-7000 XC7Z045 device, the recognition rate is 98.16% and the peak performance is 15.90 kFPS.

AB Text compression based on graph representation model (referred to as "text graph") is a fairly common approach. However, one of the difficult issues that this approach poses is how to identify nodes that have co-reference relationships in a text graph? This issue is a question that needs to be answered because previous studies have confirmed that it has a great influence on the quality of the summaries. In this article, we propose a heuristic-based method to solve the co-reference problem in Vietnamese text graphs. The effectiveness of the method that we proposed is that the quality of the summaries is improved compared to other methods are used as the basis for comparison.

   Road Detection; Vanishing Point Detection
AB In the intelligent transportation system, the geometry for the street is an important factor in vehicle monitoring. It helps to point out areas of interest, reduce computing costs, increased accuracy in detecting and identifying objects and facilitate data collection. In this paper, a new robust method of extracting the geometric model of the road is presented. The method is based on vehicle motion data to show the exact shape of the street without depending on the edge elements. First, the special features of consecutive frames are extracted and matched together. Second, by stretching the lines from matching these respective keypoints, intersections are indicated. The vanishing point is achieved by calculating the center of these intersections. Third, combining the infinity and the extremes of the motion data to tangent to the boundary of the geometry. Finally, by charting the area with the greatest matching ratio between the keypoints in the adjacent frame we reach the area of interest. Vietnam traffic dataset is used to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method has shown the correct geometry of the path. The use of motion data is a sustainable method of extracting Vanishing Point without being affected by other side effects.

AB The exponential growth of social media has created informative content, which leads to the emersion of social listening tools, in order to serve the need of companies and organizations. These tools are developed mainly in English language and for those which deal with Vietnamese, they lack the analysis capabilities to capture insightful information. In our research, we propose a framework to automatically extract and analyze information from social media, including online news and social networks. Our framework consists of multiple modules: data crawler, analysis module (topic analysis, sentiment analysis, event detection), visualization module. The results for analysis modules are promising: F1-score for topic analysis is 53%, average accuracy for sentiment analysis (using Maximum Entropy with three classes) is 62% and F1-score for event detection is 88.36%.

AB In this paper, we investigate the impact of timing mismatch among different sub-bands on the performance of a multicarrier spectral-slicing OFDM system with a single coherent receiver, both in the back-to-back configuration and long-distance fiber transmission. Two different timing mismatch models, namely linear timing error and Gaussian timing error, are introduced and investigated. Furthermore, the trade-off between nonlinear performance penalty and timing mismatch induced performance penalty under the impact of the number of subcarriers is investigated for the first time.

ID HIGH-SPEED RAILWAY; CHALLENGES
AB The migration of railway communication technology from GSM-based to LTE-based has been decided by International Union of Railway. This means that a future train control system will be one based on LTE accordingly. For the highest reliability of train operation in such a system, a fully duplicated network structure with overlaid radio cells is needed. Existing methods and results are often relied on a single network structure setup. Thus, in this work we study aspects concerning design and deployment of an LTE-based train control system with a duplicated network structure. We propose two different network structures for the system and deal with its major problems including handover and inter-cell interference. We also validate the practical feasibility of the system by experiment, in which OPNET program is used to implement our simulation models and establish numerical results. As a main achievement, this work contributes a useful reference to deployment of future LTE-based train control systems.

AB In this paper, a compact triplexer is proposed by cascading three tilted multimode interference couplers for FTTH applications. All components based on silicon rib waveguides. Firstly, a MMI coupler is designed to separate the 1310 nm wavelength band by using pseudo self-imaging technique. A tiled MMI coupler is then cascaded to separate the 1490 nm and 1550 nm wavelength bands. Numerical simulations are utilized three-dimensional beam propagation method (3D-BPM) incorporated with effective index method (EIM) for designing and optimizing the whole device. Simulation results show that an optical performance of the device satisfies with ITU G.983 recommendation.

AB This paper proposes an approach to optimize service placement on Fog landscape in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). A multi-tier fog computing architecture that supports IoT service provision is devised. Based on this architecture, a novel service placement mechanism that optimizes service decentralization on Fog landscape leveraging context-aware information such as location, time, quality of services (QoS) has been proposed. An experiment has been conducted to evaluate the proposed approach with several simulations applying to smart grid applications. The results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of reducing latency, energy consumption, and network load in comparison with the conventional cloud computing model.

DE Femtocell; Channel Reallocation; Power Consumption; Co-channel
   Interference Management
AB Future mobile networks are known to deploy a two-tier architecture of macrocell - femtocell [1]. In the two-tier architecture, femtocell downlink channels can cause strong co-channel interference to downlink transmission of macrocell users (MUs) which use the same frequency. The co-channel downlink interference to the MU might cause the MU's QoS degradation. To maintain the QoS of the MU's connection, the serving macro base station (MBS) has to increase the transmission power of the macrocell downlink. The power increment will also cause more co-channel interference to other MUs of the neighbor MBSs thus results in increasing downlink transmission power of the macrocell subsystem. In this paper, we analyze the co-channel downlink interference and then propose downlink channel reallocation schemes, denoted as MBS-sensing and CFAP-sensing schemes, in order to reduce the power consumption of the macrocell subsystem. Simulation results prove that using channel reallocation schemes provide much better downlink power consumption efficiency than the case when the channel reallocation is not deployed. In general, the CFAP-sensing scheme has better performance than the MBS-sensing scheme. However, when femtocells have long coverage radius, the MBS-sensing scheme is the better solution because it is less complex and has similar performance.

   stream priority; stream termination
AB Nowadays, 360-degree video has become an important component of virtual reality (VR) technology. Unfortunately, this state-of-the-art content type requires a huge bandwidth from a server to a client. In order to solve the bandwidth problem in streaming VR videos over HTTP/2, a dynamic adaptation method is crucial. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive streaming method based on tiled streaming. By using H.265 standard, a video at the server is divided into spatial tiles, each of which is subdivided into multiple temporal segments. In order to support adaptive streaming method from client, each tile is also encoded into different versions. The priority of tiles is defined based on the user's viewport. Then, the priority feature of HTTP/2 is used to request the server to push the tiles of higher priority first. This ensures that the visible tiles will arrive at the client and be decoded first. Besides, in the case of bandwidth fluctuation, we use the stream termination feature to cancel pushing the tiles that would arrive at the client after their playout deadlines.

AB The recent light field imaging technology has been attracting a lot of interests due to its potential applications in a large number of areas including Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality (VR/AR), Teleconferencing, and E-learning. Light Field (LF) data is able to provide rich visual information such as scene rendering with changes in depth of field, viewpoint, and focal length. However, Light Field data usually associates to a critical problem - the massive data. Therefore, compressing LF data is one of the main challenges in LF research. In this context, we present in this paper a comparative study for compressing LF data with not only the widely used image/video coding standards, such as JPEG-2000, H.264/AVC, HEVC and Google/VP9 but also with the most recent image/video coding solution, the Joint Exploration Model. In addition, this paper also proposes a LF image coding flow, which can be used as a benchmark for future LF compression evaluation. Finally, the compression efficiency of these coding solutions is thoroughly compared throughout a rich set of test conditions.

AB Surveillance visual systems play an important role in modern life, especially in the Internet of Things (IoTs) era. However, the limitation of bandwidth, energy resources and the heterogeneity of devices, networks and environments have been asking for a more powerful video coding solution, which provides not only the high compression efficiency but also the flexible scalability capability. In this context, we propose a novel scalable video coding solution, particularly designed for surveillance video content, which typically contains low motion and static scenes, thus having high temporal redundancy. In the proposed video coding framework, the conventional video coding standard, i.e., High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is wisely combined with the emerging distributed coding paradigm and following a layered coding approach to exploit the high temporal correlation between frames in surveillance video content. As assessed, the proposed surveillance distributed scalable video coding solution significantly outperforms the relevant coding benchmarks, notably with around 36,8% bitrate saving in average when compared to the HEVC simulcasting benchmark.

AB Digital watermarking is a technique that is widely used to protect rightful ownership of digital images. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid watermarking scheme for stereo images copyright protection. According to the property of stereo images, similar block pairs are located by using a certain key. Then, each block pair is transformed into DCT domain and DCT coefficients are extracted from the anti-diagonal of such block pair to form matrix A. Watermark image is embedded into singular values by applying SVD transformation on the matrix A. The experimental results showed that the proposed scheme can resist to different types of image attacks, such as salt and pepper, noise, and gaussian (density up to 5%). In addition the bit correlation ratio of extracted watermarked images is obtained up to 95%.

AB In this paper, we propose a method of protecting patient information using adaptive steganography technique on ECG (Electrocardiogram) signal. The process of embedding information uses the LSB (Least Significant Bit) matching algorithm to reduce the change on the cover object. Patient information is only embedded in the signal between the T-P wave (resting heart) to prevent the interfere with important features of the ECG signal. Experimental results show that the healthcare information is extracted accurately while the invisibility of secret data is significantly improved.

AB CAPE (Checkpointing-Aide Parallel Execution) is an approach tried to port OpenMP programs on distributed memory architectures like Cluster, Grid or Cloud systems. It provides a set of prototypes and functions to translate automatically and execute OpenMP program on distributed memory systems based on the checkpointing techniques. This solution has shown that it has achieved high performance and complete compatibility with OpenMP. However, it is in research and development stage, so there are many functions that need to be added, some techniques and models need to be improved.
   This paper presents approaches and techniques that have been applied and will be applied to optimize checkpoints and execution model of CAPE.

AB Sequential pattern mining is an important mining task for discovering sequential patterns along with their insight relationships in many real-world applications. In practice, sequence databases are kept changing over the time along with their business. For some reasons, some sequences in the database are asked to be deleted from the database. In order to have a synchronization of discovered sequential patterns with the database from which they have been discovered, the sequential pattern mining task is re-considered with many challenges. As the number of deleted sequences is often smaller than the size of the entire database, re-mining from scratch the updated database might incur a high cost because sequential pattern mining is a computationally expensive task. In this paper, our work aims at an efficient incremental mining solution to the sequential pattern mining task with sequence deletions. Different from the existing works, we propose an expanded prefix tree by extending the existing prefix tree with additional structures for capturing more necessary information for the incremental mining process. Based on this tree, we propose an incremental sequential pattern mining algorithm, SPMD, for finding a complete set of sequential patterns with no re-scanning the original database, when a number of sequences in the database are deleted. Experimental results on the benchmark databases have confirmed that our SPMD algorithm outperforms the re-mining from scratch with the PrefixSpan algorithm with less running time.

AB Time series segmentation is one of the important basic tasks in time series data mining. Indeed, it is a pre-requisite step for many other time series mining tasks such as dimension reduction, representation, classification, clustering, prediction, motif discovery and anomaly detection in time series. Since several segmentation techniques have been proposed, it is difficult to select a suitable one for a specific application if we do not know how to evaluate the performance of various segmentation methods. This paper focuses on comparing the quality of three well-known segmentation methods: Important Extreme Points, Perceptually Important Points and Polynomial Least Square Approximation by using some existing evaluation criteria for time series segmentation. However, the existing evaluation criteria required prior knowledge about the time series and their segments as external information in their criteria. Therefore, we propose one more evaluation criterion for time series segmentation. Experimental results have showed that the set of novel evaluation criteria can help to quantify segmentation results and the quality of each segmentation method depends on the characteristics of each tested dataset.

C500-toolkit is the first prototype that targets firmware image analysis of real router devices. This toolkit can extract firmware image from router flash chip in order to standardize it before monitoring its behavior during the run-time. C500-toolkit was evaluated with a real router device Netgear WNAP320 and the famous malware Linux/Mirai. Using strace to log system-calls during its runtime, we discovered some abnormal behaviors permitting to conclude that the router was not in normal behavior.

   characteristic; photovoltaic (PV) generation
AB Many studies have been conducted to analyze the maintenance of the supply-demand balance in power systems with large integration of renewable energy such as photovoltaic (PV) generation. However, very few of them have targeted the distribution network operations in Japan. One of the operation methods used to maintain the supply-demand balance at the distribution network level is conservation voltage reduction (CVR), which is an operation method for reducing the active power consumption of the load demands by decreasing the sending end voltage at the distribution substation. Although CVR is a conventional operation method, it has gained much attention in the recent years owing to the emergence of smart meters. In this study, we focus on the applicability of CVR to Japanese distribution networks with large PV generations. First, we analyze the active power consumptions of the load demands and the transmission losses, by changing the sending end voltage at the substation and considering various load characteristics. Then, we evaluate the impact of the decrease in PV power output on the total active power consumption in the distribution network.

AB this paper proposes an alternative fuzzy logic controller to create the anti-swing controller of the 3D crane system. Simultaneously, it uses more genetic algorithms (GA) to optimize the parameters inside the crane controller. The controller's purpose controls the crane's position and maintains the smallest payload swing angle possible at the desired position in order to reduce industrial accidents and increase work performance. In addition, we create a new fuzzy rule which is more effective than other fuzzy rules or controllers. This completely solves the position control but the payload swing angle is still small, making it difficult for the other controllers. Moreover, the simulated results front the proposed fuzzy rule demonstrate better robust stabilization when compared with the other fuzzy rules or controllers.

AB In the modern life, people often face a few dangerous diseases, the time is considered as gold. Therefore, the survival of patients depends on whether the doctor is right or wrong in diagnosis. While the edges of object in magnetic resonance image (MRI) are important clues, which can make doctors know the problems. In real life, medical images often have low quality, so to find the object boundaries in images is not an easy task. In this paper, a new approach to MRI edge detection issue is shown. Our proposed method includes three stages. Firstly, using the Semi Translation Invariant Contourlet Transform (STICT) to improve quality of the original MRI. Secondly, the result of first stage is subjected to image segmentation by using Fuzzy C Means (FCM) clustering method. Finally, Canny edge detection method is applied to detect the fine edges. The proposed method is better than the other recent methods based on compared results.

AB This paper presents a novel design of a passive electro-goniometer for the kinematic measurement of human ankle joint. The device is a serial mechanical linkage having six degrees of freedom, all of which are equipped with optical encoders. When attached to the user's foot and leg, it allows the measurement of all spatial parameters of the relative movement between these two body segments. The kinematics of the ankle joint (particularly the plantaldorsi flexion, pronation/supination and internal/external axial rotation) can then be computed using these data. With this special design, the authors aim to provide an effective method for the assessment of the ankle joint's capacity of movement. The measurement method will be described in detail, and first experimental results will be presented and discussed as well.

AB In this paper, the hands-free control of an electrical wheelchair proposed with processing of face images. This wheelchair can help the severely disabled move easier. Facing detection is a potential method to detect behaviors and movements of human face to control the motion of the wheelchair. In practice, the movements of head (or face - inclination) is utilized to control directions of the wheelchair such as "left", "right" and "center". While the shape of mouth is used to control two states of "stop" and "forward" of the wheelchair. The Haar-like features are applied to detect face and a Principle Component Analysis (PCA) method is employed to verify states of mouth such as "open" and "close". A Labview program was created to connect to the electric wheelchair, user and the face behavior program. The experimental results obtained in the indoor environment for the control of the hands-free wheelchair for supporting disabled people are reliable.

AB Heart disease affects seriously to human health. ECG signal is critical information to help doctor with heart diagnose prediction. In previous studies on ECG classifier, state-of-art method use MIT dataset to evaluate prediction result and record a high accuracy. However, the dataset has a long tail phenomenon where the number of normal beats is cover 83,6% of all dataset whereas some diagnose beats have a few samples. Therefore, in this paper, the state-of-art method was used to evaluate the system performance where long tail effect is removed. This method was tested in two scenarios, the first scenario is that it considers normal beat as a class for recognition, therefore we could have long-tail effect in the result. The second only consider diagnose beats where long-tail effect is removed. The experiment proves that long-tail phenomenon could affect seriously to prediction result.

   classification accuracy
AB This paper proposes with error-rate for an ECG classifier to support doctors in clinical diagnosis. In particular, ECG signals, which are diversity, may be obtained from various ECG machines on many patients. Therefore, ECG classification has been a critical challenge for scientists in recent years. In the previous studies, the ECG classification produced a promised precision. However, diversity phenomenon on patients had not been considered yet to be able to increase precision. In this paper, a performance of a state-of-art ECG-classifier in diversity scenario will be analyzed using error-rate. In this research, training and testing data are arranged to be different on MIT dataset. Thus, ECG data are separated and then extracted into each heartbeat using a discrete wavelet transform algorithm. Extracted features are trained using a state-of-art neural network method in diversity and non-diversity scenarios. Experimental results demonstrated that the accuracy of the separated data is higher using the ECG classification.

DE video-based; fall detection; abnormal gait detection; fall risk
   prediction; Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
AB Fall is one of the major health challenges facing the elderly adults, especially the adults with high fall risk factors. In this paper, we aim to build a video-based model to mitigate the consequences of fall of the elderly at two application scenarios: (1) predict the fall risk caused by unbalanced gait and (2) detect a fall event as soon as it happens. In the first stage, we use a common camera to capture the video of a person moving such as doing actions or walking. In the second stage, our proposed model for both scenarios follows the same three-module structure: (1) human object segmentation using background subtraction, (2) feature representation using two separate feature descriptors, one for each application scenario, and (3) abnormal event detection based on Hidden Markov Model. The final stage is to convey an SMS message to the pre-defined cell phone number to notify the caregiver of detected anomaly. Experimental results show the promising performance of the proposed model in terms of the acceptable accuracy and the low processing time.

   dynamic power system stability
AB This paper proposed a new emergency control of load shedding model to ensure sustained power system stability when short circuit incidents occur based on the basis of coordination algorithms applied technology knowledge: K-means clustering, artificial neural network and analytic hierarchy process algorithms. This is a load shedding model allowing to make quick decisions of strategy selection, to reduce the decision time, to recovery time and to improve frequency stability compared to traditional methods. The main purpose of the presented coordinated control system is to reduce the recovery time and maintain dynamic stability of power systems. K-means clustering algorithm divided instability mode into clusters. The results of analysis of these clusters were used as the basis for classification control. Load shedding strategies were built consists of pre-designed rules based on AHP algorithm. The load shedding was considered to cut the less important factor loads first for contributing to reduce the damages. The effectiveness of the algorithm was demonstrated through the load shedding experiment on IEEE 39 bus 10 generators compared with traditional methods.

DE Extended Kalman Filter; estimation channel; mobile OFDM
AB In this paper, the algorithms of combining channel estimation with CFO estimation are studied for mobile OFDM system. The comb-type pilot is used for channel estimation. There are some known algorithms for channel estimation such as LS (Least Square), Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), some adaptive estimators such as Kalman Filter, Extended Kalman Filter ... To enhance performance, we modified the algorithm of channel estimation by jointly estimating the channel frequency response and CFO (Channel Frequency Offset) from the transmission of known pilot symbols. This new estimator had good performance in fading environments for vehicular model with high mobile speed. Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by computer simulation.

AB The paper presents a adaptive dynamic surface control method for a class of strict-feedback nonlinear system based on neural network. In the previous adaptive neural networks control proposed using backstepping, the number and complexity of intermediate variables increase as the increasing order of the system. This makes it difficult to achieve learning for the high-order strict-feedback systems due to "the explosion of complexity". To overcome the difficulty, a stable adaptive neural DSC is proposed with auxiliary first-order filters. Due to the use of DSC, the derivative of the filter output variable is used as the NN input instead of the previous intermediate variables. This reduces greatly the dimension of NN inputs, especially for high-order systems. The controller is applied to 3 DOF surface ship model, which proposed by Fossen. The simulation results show the advantages of the proposed control algorithm and the using ability in practice.

ID WALKING; PHASE
AB In this paper, a hybrid adaptive fuzzy sliding-mode dynamic evolutionary neural network (DENN) technique is proposed for biped robot control. The hybrid control system, containing a key and a secondary controller, is implemented. The key controller combining an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode estimator and a DENN observer plays the role of the principal controller meanwhile the secondary controller is a compensator for the approximated error of the biped system uncertainty. The adaptive fuzzy controller is designed with two update rules to train the weights and the approximated fuzzy error of the estimator. Using Lyapunov principle, the adaptive fuzzy rules of the control system are derived so that the asymptotical stability of the biped system can be ensured. Eventually, simulation and experiment results confirm the efficiency, the robustness and the trajectory following performance of the new adaptive fuzzy control method for biped systems.

AB This paper proposes a new advanced adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control (AAFSMC) approach and their suitability for use in the control of a highly nonlinear 2-dof serial PAM robot. Stability proof of the stable convergence of the overall closed-loop serial PAM robot system under novel AAFSMC control is demonstrated based on Lyapunov stability principle. Simulation results prove that the proposed AAFSMC control algorithm, applied to a two degree of freedom nonlinear serial PAM robot, are successfully designed and implemented with better performance and robustness in comparison with previous SMC and fuzzy SMC approaches.

AB Gas turbine engine has the highest performance in the engine rotation. The performance of the types of modern gas turbines could able up to 44%. In specific applications, gas turbines are used for equipment such as electrical generators, aircraft engines, high-speed boat ... The applications of gas turbine are used to transmit turbine, cabinet pull in eneral[3],[5],[6],[9],[10],[12],[15]. However, there have been no published works on the use of dual turbine. This paper presents an artificial neural network controller to control Double Differential Gas Turbine (DDGT) by use algorithm to synchronize the speed of two turbines at each variable turbine load to reduce low power balance in the system. From the Rowen's model of control for a turbine, the author analyzed and combined with the existing model to construct a dual turbine combinatorial structure coupled by differential coupling. Model-driven control algorithms are used as training grounds for artificial neural networks (ANNs) to replace traditional PID controllers. Because the double tubine construction is strong nonlinear system, modeling is directly transformed from the object model. Simulation results for a dual-turbine twin-turbine combination of 32MW, demonstrating the suitability of the theory. Simulation results show that ANN can be deployed into practice to replace PID controllers to increase control accuracy.

AB This work presents a hardware implementation of a RBF NN (Radial Basis Function Neural Network), then use this RBF NN to design a PI controller for PMSM (Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor) drives. In this paper, firstly, the mathematical model of PMSM drives and the architecture of the RBF NN which consists of an input layer, a hidden layer of nonlinear processing neurons with Gaussian function and an output layer are described. Secondly, a very high speed IC hardware description language (VHDL) is adopted to describe the behavior of the RBF - PI Controller, and the data type applies 32bit length Q24 format and 2's complement operation. Additionally, finite state machine (FSM) is applied for reducing the hardware resource usage. Thirdly, to verify the correctness of the designed VHDL code for computing the RBF-PI, based on electronic design automation (EDA) simulator link, a co-simulation work is constructed by Simulink and ModelSim which the input stimuli and output responses are run in Simulink and the computation of the RBF-PI is performed in ModelSim. Finally, some simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed RBF-based PI (RBF-PI) Controller for PMSM Drives.

DE Fused deposition modeling (FDM); Dimensional accuracy; Fuzzy logic; PLA
AB Advanced manufacturing technology (AMT) is a backbone for developing the economics at the small and medium enterprises (SME). In particular, the fused deposition modeling (FMD) is one of advanced applications has been paid attention to invest for the modern manufacturing technology. FDM is a typical additive manufacturing method in rapid prototyping technology. It can make complex parts or products in short time with less human support. The accuracy of parts has been manufactured by FDM method significantly influenced by various process parameters. So, our purpose is to optimize the process parameters using fuzzy Taguchi with the aim of improving the accuracy of the products. A material used in this research is Poly lactic Acid (PLA). The parameters utilized such as thickness, the printing speed, type of building style, and filling density, are selected for design of experiments. The achieved results highlighted that the fuzzy Taguchi method is the potential to select optimal parameters for accuracy improvement.

   column; model predictive control (MPC); temperature control
AB This paper addresses the possibility of using neural network based model predictive control (NN - MPC) with receding horizon principle to control a distillation column system as well as many other nonlinear systems with complex mathematic model. A small, refined distillation column model is built using balance equations and vapor liquid equilibrium (VLE) theory to provide data set for training neural network and testing the controller. The neural network is established by measuring the system inputs and outputs from the simulating model of the plant. The neural network based model is then used to predict the future outputs for the MPC controller. The simulation results indicated that NN - MPC is capable to track the changing set-points and reject the changing disturbances with a negligible steady state error due to the estimation error of the neural network and linearization.

ID FILTERS
AB Harmonics have significant harmful effects on the electric network. Many solutions have been introduced, and one of the most popular ways is use of a shunt active power filter based on hysteresis current controller combining with an inverter. The hysteresis current controller functions to compare the current error to the upper and lower thresholds for generating the trigger pulses for the Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) bridge. The efficiency of this method depends on the displacement between upper and lower values. The smaller displacement provides a good tracking performance, but the switching frequency of the pulses sending to IGBT is very high. However, in the real world, the switching frequency of IGBT is limited, not infinity. Hence, this paper presents the methodology in which the fuzzy logic control is used for adapting the upper and lower thresholds. This work not only gives the lower value of total harmonic distortion (THD) (%THD from 29.9% to 1.54%), but also reduces the switching frequency (from 500 kHz to 60 kHz). The proposed scheme is firstly implemented and tested on MATLAB/SIMULINK environment, and then applied on experimental setup.

AB To reduce the risk of the damage due to lightning for the electrical and electronic systems within a structure, the lightning protection system has to be properly designed. This paper illustrates the influence of the main factors and parameters which affect the selection, installation and coordination of surge protective device (SPD) in protecting against surge on the low-voltage power line. The two types of SPD are manufactured according to the most typical technology are considered, namely Metal Oxide Varistor (MOV) and Triggered Spark Gap (TSG). From there, the basic recommendations are given in the effective selection SPD in protecting against surge on the low-voltage power line. Depending on the characteristics of the object to be protected, it should select the type of reasonable protection.

AB The paper proposes a hybrid classifier model for Dynamic Stability Prediction in Power System (DSPPS). The Hybrid Classifier Model (HCM) is included multiple parallel classifiers. Data for dynamic stable state in power system are very large, complex, and non-linear. These lead to making difficult for a single classifier to learn boundaries of classes. While previous works mainly concentrate on a single classifier, this paper focuses on parallel classifiers. The paper proposes using energy of samples for data partition into clusters. Each single classifier only learns a margin of each cluster. Thus, the learning is easier and classification accuracy is higher. To build HCM, feature selection, and data partition are implemented. The HCM is built by Generalize Regression Neural Network. The study is tested on IEEE 39-bus power system network.

AB In this paper, proposed an adaptive droop controller using compensate for the mismatch in voltage drops across line impedance, to enhance reactive power sharing accuracy in island microgrid. Communication is used to facilitate the tuning of adaptive controller for the change of load. The method will ensure in accurate reactive power sharing even the communication is interrupted if the load does not change during this time. If the load changes while the communication is interrupted, the accurate sharing is reduced, but the proposed method is better than the conventional droop control method. In addition, the accuracy reactive power sharing base on the proposed method is not affected by the time delay in the communication channel. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated by using simulation on Matlab/Simulink.

AB In this paper, a reactive power sharing strategy that uses droop controller combined with virtual impedance and estimating the voltage drop due to the line impedance to improve significantly improves the reactive power control and sharing accuracy. Because of, with a given minimum allowable voltage of system, the voltage droop slope cannot be made arbitrarily large, so this paper presents a better way to improve the reactive power control and sharing accuracy is to incorporate the line voltage drop effect into the power control. This can be realized by adding the coefficient slopes of the voltage into droop control, to estimate the voltage drop due to line impedance and effect of local loads. Finally, considering the different locations of loads in a multibus microgrid. The proposed reactive power cosharing strategy has been tested in simulation Matlab/Simulink.

AB This paper presents a new study of power system transient fault recognition using Wavelet Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) technique integrated with Neural Network. The proposed method requires less number of features as compared to conventional approach for the identification. The feature extracted through the wavelet is trained by a Probabilistic Neural Network for the classification of events. After training the neural network, the weight obtained is used to classify the Power Quality (PQ) problems. These techniques are applied to recognize different faults in the supply voltage of the Southern Vietnam power system at NHABE substation. The research results prove the techniques can be used to detect and classify a wide range of power different faults occurring in power systems with a high accurate ratio. The simulation results possess significant improvement over existing methods in signal detection and classification.

AB This paper proposes a new control sharing technique for parallel three-phase inverters in an islanded microgrid. The new control technique combining the adaptive impedance controller and the communication among the parallel inverters to accurately share real power and reactive power when there is a distinct difference between line impedances and the loads change in the microgrid. In this technique, the communication information is used to update the virtual impedance to compensate the voltage drop. If the interruption occurs, the stand-alone control mode is independently applied to quickly re-establish the balanced state. Therefore, the accuracy of the power sharing in this technique is within the allowed system limits. The communication network between the inverters and the control center is shown in Fig. 2 and the real and reactive power sharing controller is shown in Fig. 3. The simulation results have indicated that the proposed technique is better than the traditional droop control in terms of the accuracy and stability. Therefore, the new proposed technique can be a favorably alternative model for real power and reactive power sharing control of parallel inverters in a islanded m icrogrid.

AB In this paper, proposed an adaptive droop control method using estimated the line impedance in real time and compensate for the mismatch in voltage drops across line impedance, to enhance reactive power sharing accuracy in island microgrids. The block of line parameter estimation using the current and voltage parameters in the microgrid and estimation algorithm recursive least squares method (LSM). The Second-order generalized integrator-phase-locked loop (SOGI-PLL) is used to monitor such amplitude voltage phases and frequency at the point of common coupling (PCC) of the inverters. The line parameters are a mixture of resistance and reactance and has been estimated in real time. Therefore, the adaptive droop control method is more real, providing good performance under all conditions of load and line. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated by using simulation on Matlab/Simulink.

AB The issues related to control of reactive power in order to improve the quality of the electric transmission and distribution nowadays get more interests in readers. There are two most commonly used methods which are dynamic and static V Ar compensation (denoted by DVC and SVC respectively) for improving power factor, but both ways still remain some drawbacks such as the over/under or corrupted compensation phenomena due to DVC, or an expensive cost for a large size of inductors of SVc. This paper proposes a new scheme combining both DVC and SVC in order to get the best performance with low installing cost. The proposed scheme, called Dynamic-Static V Ar compensation (DSVC), includes two controlled loops. The inner loop, DVC controller, has a function of providing a large amount of the compensating reactive power until a little capacitive leading, then the outer loop, SVC controller, acts on the system to eliminate the over compensation from the inner controlled loop. The feed-back signal in this case is the power factor (cos phi) that is the same as the reference signal, and the power factor (PF) meter design based on the microcontrollers will be deeply described in this paper. The work is firstly validated via simulating on Matlab/Simulink, and then applied on the experimental setup. The results indicate that the proposed solution gives the good qualities not only in technical requirements, but also in financial statement.

AB This paper presents the comparative improvement of the voltage profile of the distributed power system using a Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) and a Distributed Static Synchronous Compensator (D-STATCOM). The IEEE benchmark 13-bus distributed power system is used to present the distributed power grid. A proposed DVR is connected in series with bus 632 while a D-STATCOM is connected in parallel with bus 632. Comparative simulation results of the system with DVR and D-ST A TCOM are performed by using commercial MATLAB software. It can be concluded from the simulation results that DVR is suitable to mitigate the voltage sag of the load side while D-STATCOM can enhance the voltage stability margin of the buses that are located near the connected bus of the proposed D-STATCOM in the distributed grid.

AB Recently, anomaly-based intrusion detection techniques are valuable methodology to detect both known as well as unknown/new attacks, so they can cope with the diversity of the attacks and the constantly changing nature of network attacks. There are many problems need to be considered in anomaly-based network intrusion detection system (NIDS), such as ability to adapt to dynamic network environments, unavailability of labeled data, false positive rate. This paper, we use Deep learning techniques to implement an anomaly-based NIDS. These techniques show the sensitive power of generative models with good classification, capabilities to deduce part of its knowledge from incomplete data and the adaptability. Our experiments with KDDCup99 network traffic connections show that our work is effective to exact detect in anomaly-based NIDS and classify intrusions into five groups with the accuracy based on network data sources.

AB Traffic Surveillance System (TSS) plays an important role in extracting necessary information (count, type, speed, etc.). In the area of Traffic Surveillance System (TSS), vehicle detection has emerged as an influential field of study. So far there has been a considerable amount of research to accommodate this subject. However, these studies almost address problems in developed countries where the traffic infrastructure is constructed to appropriate automobiles. Detecting moving vehicles in urban areas is difficult because the inter-vehicle space is significantly reduced, increasing the occlusion between vehicles. This issue is more challenging in developing countries where the roads are crowded with 2-wheeled motorbikes in rush hours. This paper presents a method to improve the occlusion vehicle detection from static surveillance cameras. The proposed method is a vision-based approach in which undefined blobs of occluded vehicles are examined to extract the vehicles individually based on the geometric and the ellipticity characteristic of objects' shapes. Experiments have been carried out with the real-world data to evaluate the performance and the accuracy of our method. The assessment results are promising for a detection rate of 84.10% at daytime.

AB Vehicle detection and classification is an essential application in traffic surveillance system (TSS). However, recognizing moving vehicle at nighttime is more challenging because of either poorly (lack of street lights) or brightly illuminations and chaos traffic of motorbikes. Adding to this is various type of vehicles travels on the same road which falsifies the pairing results. So, this research proposes an algorithm for vehicle detection and classification at nighttime surveillance scenes which consists of headlight segmentation, headlight detection, headlight tracking and pairing and vehicle classification (two-wheeled and four-wheeled vehicles). First, bright objects are segmented by using the luminance and color variations. Then, the candidate headlights are detected and validated through the characteristics of the headlights such as area, centroid, rims, and shape. Afterward, we present a way to tracking and pairing the headlights by calculating the area ratio, spatial information on the vertical and horizontal of a headlight. Finally, the vehicle is classified into two-wheeled and four-wheeled vehicles. The novelty of our work is that headlights are validated and paired using trajectory tracing technique. The evaluation results are promising for a detection rate of 81.19% in nighttime scenes.

AB In the traffic surveillance system (TSS), there are many factors affect the qualities of the result. Through practical application, it is difficult to determine which scene changing during the day period, from the daylight to nighttime, the conversion of the sunny and overcast, wet and dry scene. However, there have been no controlled studies which illustrate the method to distinguish environment scene, which is the one of six main challenges in TSS. Therefore, this paper presents the method to detect and recognize the change of scene during all-day surveillance; Thus, TSS adopt the recognition to determine the appropriate method for each scene, for increasing performance. Our recognition model is based on the combination of the CIE-Lab color space and the histogram of the region-of-interest (ROI) in each frame, which used for extracting the feature for the Feed Forward Neural Network to perform the detection. In the experiment section, our results show that the benefits of our proposed method in the real-world traffic surveillance system.

AB Pronunciation errors are often made by language learners. Especially, systematic mispronunciations, consisting of substitutions of native sounds for sounds of the target language that do not exist in the native language, are considered a big problem for language leaners. Therefore, automatic detection of this kind of errors is essential to building a Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) system supporting language learners to improve their pronunciation. In this research, we focused on detecting systematic pronunciation errors made by Vietnamese learners of English. To this end, we used SVM classifiers, which are trained by a native corpuses (TIMIT) and a non-native corpus (V.E Corpus). The non-native corpus, constructed by the researchers and annotated by two Vietnamese trained professionals, includes 1550 utterances from 31 Vietnamese students. Each of the students was asked to read 50 English sentences designed to contain English phonemes frequently mispronounced by Vietnamese speakers. The experimental results showed that the detectors can achieve at least 79% SAR and 10% FAR.

AB In this paper, the significance role of data warehouse designing for textual anti-plagiarism system is investigated. The paper covers the central issues of data warehousing modeling including: (1) formulating the data representation, (2) establishing the foundations of storage structure, (3) proposing corresponding architecture allowing to store, update and manage data. Consequently, two levels are considered in this paper to address the above mentioned research axes. First, at a theoretical level, the objective is to introduce novel and practical contributions in the area of textual document-based plagiarism system. The chosen approach is proposed to collect, analysis and store textual dataset. Secondly, at an implementation level, the paper focuses on the platform for processing the data, calling to modeling exhibits promising capabilities such as support for real-time, new sources of data, and self-service capabilities. The real application is performed in Vietnamese text-based document by conducting documents containing final reports/assignments, dissertations of master/Ph.D and research scientific papers applied for the University of Danang. The contribution of the paper is not only provide values to all researchers, educators and students in the university of Danang systems but also be considered as seminal work to develop plagiarism in our further next investigation of building a big-data warehouse severing for a automatic duplicate system.

   security; outage probability
AB In this paper, we propose a simple multi-hop cooperative transmission protocol (MCT) to decrease outage probability for multi-hop networks under impact of hardware impairments and presence of an eavesdropper. In the proposed method, the source and intermediate relays adjust their transmit power so that the eavesdropper cannot overhear the transmitted data. We derive exact closed-form expressions of outage probability (OP) and the average number of time slots (TS) used to relay the data from the source to the destination for the MCT protocol over Rayleigh fading channel. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to verify the theoretical derivations. Results show that the proposed protocol outperforms multi-hop direct transmission one (MDT), in terms of the average OP and TS.

DE Color face recognition (FR); color local texture features; color spaces;
   local binary pattern (LBP)
AB Color local texture features (CLTF), proposed by Choi et al., exploit the discriminative information derived from spatiochromatic texture patterns of different spectral channels within a certain local face region to maximize the complementary effect taken by using both color and texture information for face recognition. Previous comparative experiments show that the CLTF extracted from ZRG and RQCr color spaces yield better recognition rates than FR approaches using only color or texture information. Nevertheless, it has been revealed that different color spaces have distinct characteristics, and thus effectiveness, in terms of discriminating power for the task of visual classification. Hence, in this research, we conduct extensive and comparative experiments to evaluate CLTF extracted from many different color spaces on four data sets, namely Color FERET, AR, SCFace, and Postech01. The results show that their performance is not consistent on different databases. This raises the need to develop a framework of choosing components from existing color spaces for the purpose of enhancing CLTF's discriminating power.

AB This paper describes the establishment of a machine vision system for measurement compression spring. This kind of spring is used in the automotive suspension systems on cars. The special features for this kind spring are non-uniform diameter, non-regular helix and non-unique center line. A reverse engineering to construct spring geometry for further manufacturing becomes necessary when there is no CAD data for this spring. The reverse measurement facilities include contact stylus instrument, laser scanner and white-light grating system. These devices can be used to measure spring, but time and money consuming is a common problem with this measurement solution. In this paper, a new method with low-cost measurement developed to solve this problem. A man-machine interface for measurement by Visual Basic 6.0 has been developed which adopted a single camera mounted in a three-axis measurement frame. A fixed focal length camera and image processing technique were used to construct the object's position as well as coordinates. Therefore, the spiral of the measured spring can be constructed. By comparing the measured data to the ATOS system with Poly-works, the differences can be obtained. The largest upper deviation is about 3.3 mm and the largest lower deviation about -2.7 mm for spring geometry construction.

AB This paper presents an experimental method to measure the thickness of oil film of a connecting-rod big end bearing. A specific experimental device and a connecting-rod 7 model of photo-elastic material are used to determine the load diagram and to measure the oil film thickness. The method consists in taking two images of a solid, before and after deformation. The surface of the connecting rod is painted with dark spots. Reference images, before deformations, and deformed images are recorded by using a CCD camera and imaging software at different angular positions of the crankshaft. We have developed a technique to measure the thickness of the film by the correlation method of digital images. The measurements of oil film thickness according to the crank angle corresponding with the load diagram and are confirmed by electrohydrodynamic lubrication. The thicknesses of film thus measured can then be compared with the thicknesses given by the numerical calculations.

AB In this paper, we propose a mining algorithm for average-utility item sets (EHAUI-Tree) based on improving HUUI-Tree algorithm to apply for adding new database transactions without restart. At first, the value of updated data is calculated. Then, item sets which make changes will be calculated and updated depending upon the updated data value and the previous High Average-utility Upper-bound (HAUUB). This algorithm uses the downward closure property of an average-utility item set and an index table structure. In addition, a data structure for item sets is proposed to minimize memory usage and maximize calculating efficiency. The experimental result shows that EHAUI-Tree is more effective than HAUl-Tree when adding new transactions for the previous database. The method applies the downward closure properties of HAUUB Item set and Index Table. Furthermore, the Bit-Array-structure item set is also proposed to reduce using memory and calculate more effectively. The result of this algorithm is better than HAUl-Tree on updating new transactions.

   Tracking; Two Degree of freedom (2DOF) Control Scheme
ID INTERNAL-MODEL CONTROL; SYSTEMS
AB A new analytical method for a proportional-integral-derivative (pm) controller cascaded with a lead/lag filter based on the basis of the renowned internal model control (IMC) theory is proposed for the first-order plus dead time (FOPDT), the integrator plus dead time (IPDT), and the unstable FOPDT processes. Analytical tuning rules for the pm filter controller are derived in the transparent way for enhancing the disturbance rejection. A two degree of freedom (2DOF) control scheme is utilized to cope with both the regulatory and servo problems in a simple manner. Several illustrative examples are conducted for a broad class of time-delay processes and the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method affords better performances for both the disturbance rejection and set-point tracking in compared with those of recently well-known design methods, since the controllers in the simulation study are all tuned to have the same degree of robustness in terms of the maximum sensitivity. To demonstrate the robustness of the controllers, the worst-case model mismatch is introduced by inserting perturbation uncertainty in all process parameters simultaneously. The resulting pm characteristics confirm that the proposed controllers hold greater robustness against perturbation uncertainty.

ID DESIGN
AB kind modular robotic, nonlinear and the system subjected to nonholonomic constraints. It is impossible to obtain an exact dynamics model due to unknown parameters, unpredictable and irregular features, external disturbance. This paper proposes an adaptive robust controller to guide WMR to follow the desired trajectory. The cascade control system is applied and the influence from external disturbances, parametric uncertainties in WMR are compensated by the robust-adaptive nonlinear control law at inner loop based on certainty equivalence adaptive technique. The asymptotic stability of the whole system is analyzed by using Lyapunov theory showing that asymptotic convergence of tracking errors to the origin in presence of uncertainties and external disturbances. The simulation results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed controller for trajectory tracking.

The sorting process induding some steps as detecting the object, determining the object properties like color, size, and shape, ... , locating of the object, and using the ability of ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) to calculate the actual gripping position. A five layer neural network of ANFIS is used to adjust input and output parameters of membership function in a fuzzy logic controller. The hybrid learning algorithm is used for training this network. In this algorithm, the least square estimation method is applied for the tuning of linear output membership function parameters and the error hybrid method is used to tune the nonlinear input membership function parameters, it is possible to predict position exacdy for actuators and reduce interpolation errors of the system. The algorithms will be experimented on tomatoes and passion fruits, results will be analyzed and evaluated to calculate the stable of the vision system, so that the productivity and accurate efficiency is appropriate.

AB In this paper, a new design of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for the active vehicle suspension system (AVSS) of a quarter car model is proposed on the basis of the well-known Internal Model Control (IMC) theory in order to compromise the two conflicting criteria between the passenger ride comfort and road handling. By using the given mathematical ordinary differential equations (ODFs) and state-space matrix expression in t-domain via the kinematic and dynamic of a quarter two degrees of freedom model, the transfer function is firstly established for its model and the proposed AVSS based PID control is then systematically introduced for enhancing the ride comfort. Moreover, the computer simulation model of the passive and active suspension systems is established for the purpose of having a fair comparison. A various kinds of the road input signals are selected for testing the systems, such as unit step, sine wave, and white noise signals. The simulation results indicate that the performance of proposed AVSS has the significantly improved in terms of reducing the peak overshoot of sprung mass displacement and sprung mass acceleration in compared with the other traditional passive suspension systems.

AB In this paper, an adaptive proportional integral derivative (PID) based on radial basic function neural networns (APID-RBFNs) is proposed for tracking control of a 2 degree of freedom (DOF) parallel manipulator. For developing the controller, a dynamic model of this parallel manipulator is developed based on a matrix form equations. APID-RBFNs is designed to overcome external disturbances and complex noises acting on the parallel manipulator system by using adaptive PID sliding surface with RBFNs. By using the Lyapunov method, the stability of the overall system with full state constraints is proved. The simulation results in universal software Matlab/Simulink show that the proposed control strategy has better dynamic performance and robustness than conventional PID tracking control.

AB This paper proposes a method to optimize the structure of the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) by using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The combination of PSO and RBFNN can overcome the disadvantages of RBF neural network. The PSO algorithm is used to determine the number of hidden neurons, initial weights, center and base widths in RBF neural network. After being optimised, the RBF neural network-based controller is applied in trajectory tracking to control an Omnidirectional Mobile Robot. This is a holonomic robot that can be operated easily in small and narrow spaces, due to flexible rotational and translational movementing, simultaneously and independently. The simulation results in MATLAB Simulink show that PSO-RBF-PD Supervisory controller was better than RBF-PD Supervisory controller.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB The work represents a dynamic programming and piecewise linearization based control strategy for a perturbed discrete-time nonlinear system. Firstly, the perturbed discrete-time nonlinear system is linearized at each sampling time. The origin system is approximated by infinite number of the linearized models. Then, the disturbances are estimated under the assumption of slow variations in input and state during a sampling period. Finally, a controller based on the dynamic programming method is designed. The proposed control strategy is applied to control a boiler-turbine system and compared to the other method with the usage of numerical simulation. The simulation results show that the proposed method gives better performance in term of overshoot and smoothness of control signals and it can be applied to other plants in industry.

AB This paper presents the design of a compliant bio-inspired camera-positioning mechanism. The device combines human muscle actuation scheme and spherical mechanism with the aim of miniaturizing the orienting mechanism. The active orientation system which controls two DOFs (pan and tilt) were synthesized by using compliant mechanism. The flexible mechanisms utilize the deflection of curved beams to drive the orienting modules. Ashape and size optimization process using genetic algorithm was used for the design. The multi-objective of the optimization problem is the maximum orienting angles and a linear input-output relation. To demonstrate the feasibility of the optimum design, finite element analysis was carried out. The results show that the proposed design exhibits essential characteristics of a camera-orientation system such as light weight, compactness and high precision.

AB In this paper, experimental results about the speed stability of one shaft operating by using the hydraulic motor with proportional valve are presented. Exclude the elastic deformation of the transmission belt. Besides, the mathematical model and fuzzy self-tuning PID controller is introduced. In the model, the V-belt is assumed as an elastic module and the friction coefficient and mass inertia moment of the hydraulic motor can be considered as constant. The Matlab is used to simulate the speed response of the hydraulic motor to the working shaft. The main parameters for the experimental investigation are setting time, overshoot and error of rotation at the steady state. So, speed stability of the working shaft operating by the hydraulic motor which is controlled by the proportional valve with the fuzzy self-tuning PID controller. Based on our findings, we propose the applicability on the main shaft of the metal cutter.

AB In this paper, we propose an extended navigation framework for autonomous mobile robots in dynamic environments using a reinforcement learning algorithm. The main idea of the proposed algorithm is to provide the mobile robots the relative position and motion of the surrounding objects to the robots, and the safety constraints such as minimum distance from the robots to the obstacles, and a learning model. We then distribute the mobile robots into a dynamic environment. The mobile robots will automatically learn to adapt to the environment by their own experienced through the trial-and-error interaction with the surrounding environment. When the learning phase is completed, the mobile robots equipped with our proposed framework are able to navigate autonomously and safely in the dynamic environment. The simulation results in a simulated environment shows that, our proposed navigation framework is capable of driving the mobile robots to avoid dynamic obstacles and catch up dynamic targets, providing the safety for the surrounding objects and the mobile robots.

AB Robotic systems are widely used in the manufacturing industries to improve high quality products. When a fault occurs in manipulator, the faulty robot operates in abnormal condition, which causes insecurity for devices and human. In general, the dynamic of residual vector consists of fault information. In order to evaluate the residual vector, data-driven technique based on statistical theory is used This paper presents a method by using the combination between the residual vector and data-driven solution for detecting and isolating actuator, sensor faults in robot manipulator. To achieve the accurate and reliable detection and isolation of sensor and actuator faults, the threshold is proposed to combine with generalized momenta. Simulation results are realized to show the performance of proposed method

AB A complete overview in recent years, concerned with the classification, control methods, applications and future works for two-wheeled mobile robot (TWMR), is presented. There have been three main types of TWMRs: input coupling, without input coupling and reaction wheel. For the second model (TWMR without input coupling), a variety of control methods have been proposed from the classical method PID to advanced methods such as sliding mode control, adaptive control, robust control, back-stepping, and fuzzy inference system based control. There have been vital applications of TWMRs, for example, Segway, E-scooter and TWMR based cars. There have been some unsolved challenging control problems, such as controllability, moving on non-flat surface, inclined path, control of TWMRs with input-coupling, control of TWMRs with reaction wheel and safety.

AB This paper analyzes the effects of resistance, capacitance and self-inductance on the self-induced energy in hybrid ignition system. Simulation and experiment results not only present this effect on hybrid ignition system, but also use to adjust the primary current equation and self - induced emf equation. Experimental data - primary current and self-induced emf - is collected by PicoScope 4425 Automotive Oscilloscope and used to correct the primary current, self-induced emf and oscillation frequency equation. Simulation results from Matlab show that the primary current, self-induced emf and oscillation frequency is continuously affected by changing resistance, capacitance and self-inductance in the hybrid ignition system. Other aspect which is also investigated in this paper is accumulated energy in capacitor. The simulated energy details that the accumulated energy in a capacitor is greater than the required ignition energy, which ensures hybrid system working fluently.

AB This paper presents a study related to Hybrid Electric Motorcycle (HEM) with a front wheel DC electric hub motor using Lithium Ion battery that renovated from Honda Lead 110cc. The rear wheel is driven by drive train integrated with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) as its origin. Both of them are able to provide propulsion torque separately or simultaneously. Fuel consumption and performance characteristics of the proposed design will be evaluated by a dynamic simulation model in Matlab/Simulink. The obtained results show that plug - in hybrid structure without generator is the most feasible and effective choice to renovate a traditional scooter in traffic condition of many populous cities in Vietnam. The study also illustrated fuel economy can save up to 21.1% with the same performance characteristics between the plug - in hybrid scooter and original one.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB In this study, a fault detection algorithm based on Kalman filter approach based on the tire rotational dynamics is proposed to identify bearing fault in wheels of four in-wheel motor electric vehicles. If one wheel with partial fault is detected, feedforward compensation of bearing damping torque is added to the wheel motor torque distributed by the control allocation which integrated the MTTE-Maximum Transmissible Torque Estimator. If the one wheel with partial fault is detected, then feedforward compensation of the bearing damping torque is added to the wheel motor torque distributed by the control allocation. For the complete fault, the control allocation is necessary to be reconstructed. Other remaining normal wheels will be used for torque distribution. The bearing fault detection is faster than our previous study, because of applying Kalman filter approach in identification. That leads to improvement of lateral stability performances which are demonstrated for double lane change in simulation.

In this paper, we present simple but efficient approach to determine the optimum sequence in CNC punching manufacturing. Algorithm is integrated into a punching manufacturing. The result are produced in form of G-codes showing the hole punching sequence that shortens the punching tool travel path. Finally, these G-codes can be integrated directly to CNC punching machines. After that, products are tested in factory. The results show that the algorithm is more effective, the quality is the same.

ID TEMPERATURE; PARAMETERS
AB In this study, the mold operation fluid will be controlled for observing the cooling efficiency of conventional cooling and pulsed cooling. The cooling techniques will be compared under varying mold temperature, coolant temperature, melt temperature, and flow rate. A mold structure was built using stainless steel 420. The cavity plate contains two cavities. Each cavity will be used for one type of part thickness. Results show that by appropriately controlling the fluid in pulsed cooling, the cooling rate can be improved from 0.552 degrees C/s to 0.755 degrees C/s and the warpage can be reduced by 20%. Moreover, as compared with conventional cooling, pulsed cooling can reduce warpage by 20% because pulsed cooling can maintain a stable heating/cooling temperature history and offer sufficient cooling to reduce warpage.

ID OF-THE-ART
AB Nowadays, the wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM) is widely accepted in the manufacturing industry. This is because WEDM can machine any conducted material regardless of its hardness. Moreover, WEDM can cut complex geometries and micro parts with a very small thickness and provide very high accuracy and low surface roughness. Many researches about WEDM have been carried out during its development history since 1960s and many of these researches were conducted to improve the machining efficiency, one of the main weakness of the WEDM. This paper presents the development of a WEDM system that applies a vibration-assisted process which improve the machining efficiency of the system. In addition, a developed feed-rate control system that drives the machining process at a very high rate and efficiency are also presented.

AB This paper presents the fundamentals of designing and manufacturing a rotary feeder for feeding plastic moulded Tee 90 degrees. This feeder consists of an inclined rotating disc and revolving bowl. The parts are metered from a prefeeder on this inclined rotating disc. The disc carries the parts to the rim of the rotating bowl in a single lane due to the centrifugal forces. Fixed mechanical qualifiers orient and qualify the parts. Improperly oriented parts are ejected from the rim to the disc for recirculation. Properly oriented parts moved out of the rim and out of the feeder. They are carried by a horizontal belt conveyor for coding by laser. The aims of the research is to design and manufacture a rotary feeder with the capacity up to 200 parts per minute. In addition, the feeder is capable of performing at very low noise levels, feeding parts reliable and efficient, and improving the work environment for the operator.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB The changeover from eutectic Sn-Pb solders to lead-free solders has been driven by environmental concerns and market accessibility in the last few years. Moreover, characterization of solder alloys is of primary importance for manufacturers due to their wide use as interconnects in electronic devices. There are many tests used to identify the material parameters of the solder alloys. Most often, the traditional extensometer technique is used to measure the tensile strain between two points, which provides average strain along a direction. However, it is difficult to find the strain information at occurrence of necking and the results measured from an extensometer may not be accurate. This paper focuses on a non-contact technique, namely Digital Image Correlation, to investigate the full-field strain and displacement fields during a test.

AB This paper presents an investigation on combined surface modifications and their effects to tribological properties of Si (100) flat surfaces. At first, micro-patterns were fabricated on Si wafers using photolithography and DRIE (Deep Reactive Ion Etching) fabrication techniques. The patterns include of pillars and channels shape in micro-scales. Secondly, the Si micro-patterns were coated by thin diamondlike carbon (DLC) or Perfluoropolyether (ZDOL) film, individually. The surfaces were then evaluated for the friction and wear properties at micro-scale. Results showed that the patterned surface exhibited reduced friction force compared to the Si flat surfaces, owing to reduced area of contact. Further, the combination of micro-patterns and tribology films such as DLC and ZDOL in this work is very effective in reducing frictional force and wear of the Si flat surface, and would be proved as a potential candidate for tribological applications in miniaturized devices like MEMS.

Before the implementation of GA, sensitivity analysis of design variables is performed by using the combination of FEA-based experiments, Taguchi method and variance analysis ANOVA. The designed CGM is used as an amplification mechanism for the precision tool feeder of a CNC machine from the ultra-precision actuation of a piezo actuator (PZT). The design is validated in a 3-dimensional FEA model using Ansys. The result shows that the maximum amplification ratio obtained from the CGM is 6.8 with a very high linearity for the transformation.

   Feasibility Region
AB The issue of nonlinear model predictive control has always been a topic of much concern. We will propose a new approach to robust nonlinear model predictive control to class of nonlinear model system with input constraint under state-dependent disturbances. The considered class of model is separated into linear part at current state, nonlinear part and state-dependent disturbances which are assumed to have their bound. The state-feedback control law is obtained by that solving optimization problem of upper bound of infinite horizon cost function with input constraint via LMIs. In this paper, in order to guarantee robust stability, the proposed approach must generates feasible regions which ensures the existence of a solution and stable region bounded by that. Moreover, these regions are able to contract after every sampling time to proof the robust stability of the system. The simulation results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed approach to RNMPC.

AB A tractor-trailer wheeled robot (TTWR) is a kind of modular robotic system that consist of the tractor and the trailer are mechanically coupled to each other. It is impossible to obtain an exact dynamics model due to unknown parameters, or unpredictable and irregular features, external disturbance. Because of the non-holonomic constraints property, this paper proposes an adaptive robust cascade controller to guide TTWR to follow the desired trajectory. The influence from external disturbances, parametric uncertainties in TTWR are compensated by the robust-adaptive nonlinear control law at inner loop. The asymptotic stability of the whole system is point out based on Lyapunov theory. The simulation results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed controller for trajectory tracking.

AB Multi-motor drive systems have been widely used in many modern industry. It is a nonlinear, multi-input mUlti-output (MIMO) and strong-coupling complicated system, including the effect of friction and elastic. The control law for this dive system based on the determining of the tension. However, it is hard to obtain this tension in practice by using a load cell or a pressure meter due to the accuracy of sensors or external disturbance. In order to solve this problem, a highgain observer is proposed to estimate the state variables in this drive system, such as speeds, tension. An emerging proposed technique in the control law is the use of high-gain observers together with state feedback control to obtain a separation principle for the stabilization of whole system. The theory and simulation results point out the good performance of the proposed output feedback for the drive system.

AB The paper proposes an approach to design optimal receding horizon controller for tracking control a TRMS (twin rotor multiple input multiple output system), which is a nonlinear system with two degrees of freedom, cross couplings and perturbed additionally by system disturbances. On the contrary to all other MPC controllers, which use consistently a finite horizon and discrete time model of controlled object, the here proposed controller uses an infinite horizon and continuous time nonlinear model. Hence it always guarantees the adaptive tracking stability of obtained closed loop systems in real time, without using an additional penalty function in objective function as usual. The obtained simulation results by using this controller have confirmed its promising applicability in practice.

AB This paper presents an adaptive backstepping hierarchical sliding mode control algorithm for uncertain 3D overhead crane model. Backstepping sliding mode is constructed based on hierarchical structure to guarantee tracking for trolley and anti-swing for load. Neural network is adopted to approximate the uncertain terms. The disadvantage of sliding mode control is fixed by changing signum function to saturation function. The purposes of this paper are to use RBF neural network to approximate nonlinear function of crane, design hierarchical sliding mode controller based on Lyapunov theory.

AB The issue of applying H-infinity to control wheeled inverted pendulum is a topic of much concern on account of underactuated and nonlinear model. Authors in [I] selected Lyapunov candidate function presented following HJ equation. Almost previous papers using H - infinity to control WIP must assume that desired accelerator is zero and model is linearized at origin, leading to that system does not obtain global asymptotical stability when angular error leave neighborhood of origin. In this paper, we propose a new control method applying H - infinity and Backstepping technique based on Lyapunov direct method to stabilize tracking error to converge to arbitrary ball of origin. The simulation results of WIP under bounded disturbances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

AB This paper presents a hybrid control which includes swing-up and balancing control for pendubot system a two-link under-actuated robot. The parameters of the pendubot system are measured in the actual pendubot system built in the automation lab, University of Technology and Education HCM City. A hybrid controller which drives the system close to the equilibrium manifold and maintains the system stabilization in the upright position will be developed. The proposed control consists of two stages: swing-up control using partial feedback linearization, and balancing control using linear quadratic regulator. Finally, the controller is verified through both simulation and experimental results. The stability of the pendubot system in simulation showed that the proposed hybrid controller works well. However, the control quality in the experimental model still has some limitations.

DE Autopilot; Fuzzy Logic Controller; Line-of-Sight
AB Autopilot system are valuable for many applications, such as: oceanographic, military purposes, maritime transport,... which offer greater self-adaptive capacity and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional systems. Especially, this is a common and an essential problem for Unmmaned Surface Vessel (USV) due to the non-linearity of the system and the changing environmental conditions. This paper focus on design, modelling and simulation a Fuzzy path-keeping autopilot for an USV with the modified Line of Sight (LOS) law compared to conventional LOS guidance. The heading deviation and rate of heading deviation are treated as Fuzzy inputs and the rudder angle command is the Fuzzy output. The Fuzzy-controller for USV is verified by Matlab simulation. The archived results confirm the effectiveness of the LOS approach.

   Trajectory planning
AB This paper presents a non-geometric method for solving the inverse kinematics of a ship motion simulation system having Delta structure as shown in Fig. 1, and then investigated the problem of path tracking control generally. As the complexity of the joint structure of this system, obtaining the inverse kinematics is difficult and computationally expensive and traditional methods such as geometric, iterative and algebraic seem not completely effective. So, author uses the ability of ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) to learn from training data, it is possible to create ANFIS with limited mathematical representation of the system. Simulation is carried out by Matlab to indicate that this method has the advantage of faster learning rate, higher identifying precision and better real-time ability. The purpose of trajectory control is to define a temporal motion law along a given geometric path. A method for trajectory control is presented which is based on a modified trapezoidal velocity profile (TVP), and velocity control method is proposed using a PID controller to ensure the end effector tracking the desired path with high precision. At last, a demo model is used to verify the feasibility of the method. The results of the paper are very useful for solving the inverse kinematics of manipulator as well as demonstrate the improved performance of controller combining between TVP and PID over conventional trajectory control - point to point type.

   Authenticator
AB This work proposes a novel authentication method for identifying Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based on a channel-tap power. A ground control station utilized the channel-tap power as a radio-frequency fingerprint (RFF) to directly detect UAVs via physical (PRY) layer. The proposed authentication method uses the Neyman-Pearson test to discriminate between two UAVs, U AV(I) and U AV(A), which are controlled by the ground control station. The proposed methods helps the ground control station completely detect U AV(I) and U AV(A) using PRY layer. Finally, the performances are analyzed, and simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed authenticator. From simulation results, for SNR=-5 dB and the false alarm probability of 0.2, the ground control station can detect the UAV with the detection probability of 0.90 under the UAV speed of 70 km/h.

AB This paper presents an active disturbance rejection rejection control design for integrated guidance and control missile based on sliding mode control and extended state observer. The integrated model is formulated as a block-strict-feedback nonlinear system, in which modeling errors, unmodeled non-linearities, target maneuvers, etc. are viewed as unknown uncertainties. The nonlinear control law is designed based on backstepping and sliding mode control (SMC) techniques. Based on the principle of active disturbance rejection control (ADRC), enhanced feedback linearization (FL) based control law is implemented for the IGC model using the estimates generated by an extended state observer (ESO). The stability analysis of the closed-loop system is also conducted. Simulation results show that, small miss distances and smooth missile trajectories are achieved, and the system is robust against system uncertainties and external disturbances.

AB A stator-flux-oriented vector controller of induction motor is often used in the controllers due to less depending on parameters of the motors, the parameters of the motors are nonlinear and time-varying solution conditions slip control will be applied by the brilliant advantages of stability control is slipping sustainable and as soon as the system noise. On the other hand, when the parameters of nonlinear objects changes over time, the problems keep constant speed when the load changes are difficult to implement, therefore the neural network is used to identify the speed of machines are needed to increase the stability control system. This article presents a new method of designing sliding mode controller based on radial basic function network (RBF) for three-phase asynchronous motors based a stator-flux-oriented vector controller. Two sliding controllers are designed independently for stator-flux-vector estimation and torque, in which magnetic flux is estimated and the speed of the motor is identified by RBF network, combined seven-level cascade inverter with a reduction common-mode algorithm applied to increase the stability for the controller. Simulations and experiments using Matlab / Simulink for 1-hp induction motor drive, typed 150-rad / s squirrel cage rotor, the results present velocity followed setting values at the frequency change from the lowest 50-rad/s to 150 rad highest/s, the system is still stable when the stator is changed stator resistance and rotor resistance up to 1.5 times the original value.

AB Most of quadcopter operate in the outdoor environment where is often complex and unpredicted. In order to control the quadcopter in unknown outdoor environment, it should be designed an excellent filter to estimate complete state vector which illustrates the movement of rigid body. In this paper, two filters such as Complementary and Kalman are investigated to compare the performance. Quadcopter collect only measurements from a low-cost inertial measurement unit, IMU-MPU6050. The raw data is put into filter to estimate the state vector in system. In the simulations, these filters are studied to implement in the model of quadrotor. Later, the hardware platform of quadcopter is built to denote experimental results in order to validate the effective design of Complementary filter and Kalman filter in quadcopter.

AB Teleoperation is a human control system enabling humans to interact with the remote environment through a dual robot system which includes a master robot and a slave robot operating in two different places. Wave variables and scattering approaches were proposed in [1],[2] with constant time delay, [3],[4] with varying time delays. This paper develops them based on different wave variables and new passivity control to guarantee the stability of the whole system against varying time delays without assumption that absolute derivative of time delays is smaller than one. The validity of the control law is based on passivity theory. In addition, force controller design is considered for increasing transparency of system. The simulation results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed controller for position synchronization.

AB Wireless sensor networks are composed of many sensor nodes limited to residual energy. The sensor nodes are randomly scattered within in the ranger monitoring and sending - receiving data by radio waves. The measured data often contains the same information, and sending to base station causes the waste of energy of sensor nodes and the risk of congestion. According to the statistics, the energy consumed by transceiver radio signals is many times greater than the energy consumes to process other tasks of sensor node including the calculation on the sensor node. In this paper, we propose algorithms installed on the sensor nodes to monitor non-cyclical target fixed, which base on the fluctuation of the target when it exceeds the threshold. Moreover, algorithm control sensor nodes measures just in time fluctuations exceeded targets need to measure.

AB Bilateral teleoperation is a robotic system helping humans to work with the remote environment through a dual robot which includes a local robot and a remote robot operating with considerable time delays. In order to overcome this obstacle, beside the proposed wave variables and scattering approaches [I], [2], the conventional methods without wave variables has been pointed out in [3], [4] with constant time delay. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive control law based on Lyapunov's direct method to address time varying delays and position synchronization between two robots. In addition, force control was considered to guarantee tracking position error which converges to zero under humans and environment disturbances. The validity of them is based on theory and the good performance of the proposed controller shown in simulation results.

AB This paper analyzes and evaluates joint effect of primary interference and artificial noise on information securing capability of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) under interference power constraint, peak transmit power constraint, and Rayleigh fading. An exact formula for an important security performance metric, secrecy outage probability, is first derived and then validated by computer simulations. Finally, this exact formula is used to provide numerous results to show security performance saturation at large peak transmit power or large peak interference power, adverse effect of primary interference on security performance, and security performance improvement owing to artificial noise.

AB In this paper, we design Tetris game which can rotate, generate randomly blocks, eliminate rows, and get scores based on FPGA. Multi-bit Flip-flops (MBFF) concept is implemented into a part of Tetris game to save power consumption and clock buffer area. The 2-bit MBFF and 4-bit MBFF technique are compared with the Single-Bit Flip-flop. Results show that Multi-bit Flip-flops technique is very effective and efficient method in lower power designs and saving clock buffers. The low power Tetris game is a successful model for other visual control systems.

AB Scaling CMOS integrated circuit technology leads to decrease the chip price and increase processing performance in complex applications with re-configurability. Thus, VLSI architecture is a promising candidate in implementing neural network models nowadays. Backpropagation algorithm is used for training multilayer perceptron with high degree of parallel processing. Parallel computing implementation is the best suitable on FPGA or ASIC. The on-chip back-propagation learning algorithm design is proposed to implement 2x2xl neural network architecture on FPGA. The simulation results show that back-propagation learning algorithm is converged in 3 epochs with error target as small as 0.05. The updated weighting also makes comparison between learning on FPGA and Matlab less than 2%. The achievements extend the applications with larger neural networks to communicate with other hardware architecture.

AB Recently, the major challenge in the robustness evaluation of networks is to enhance the detecting the most critical nodes. Many researchers have studied the problem of detecting the list of attacked nodes, which are the number of failed nodes is maximum, in order to protect these nodes. However, there is no any previous works to consider the cost of attacks that the budget is limited is very practical in the real attacks. In this paper, we study the problem of attacking nodes in networks to maximize the total profits of attacked nodes, where the total cost of attacks is remained under the budget. In addition, an algorithm is proposed to solve problem of attacking nodes in the network with limited budget while guaranteeing the high total profits of attacked nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed method provides good performance.

AB Nowadays, the problem of using minimum number of time slots for data aggregation such that sensors can work without data collision for data transmissions has received a great deal of attention in Wireless Sensor Network (WRSN). It is worth mentioning that there exists many approaches that are tried to reduce the number of time slots for data aggregation in WSNs. However, most of previous works are fallen into reducing time slots in certain circle. In this paper, we investigate the problem of Reducing Data Aggregation Time without Data Collision (RDATDC) problem and first propose a new overlap circle technique, which is termed the OverlapCircle- based algorithm (OCBA), to solve the RDATDC problem. Simulation results show that the OCBA has better performance than other method.

AB Because of the limited energies of sensors, efficient data gathering in wireless sensor network has been received a great deal of attention recently. To prolong the network lifetime, in this paper, we study the problem of scheduling a mobile sink to some specific nodes, termed anchor nodes in this paper, for data collection and reducing the energy consumption of data transmission. While considering data aggregation and imbalance initial energies of sensors, a method, termed the Heuristic Algorithm, is proposed to prolong the lifetime of wireless sensor networks. In addition, a simulation is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Simulation results show that our proposed method performs better than other existing method.

AB This paper presents the implementation of a decentralized modulation for the control of multilevel converters requiring phase-shifted carriers. Contrary to the principle using a "master" controller providing a set of interleaved carriers, the proposed method uses local interconnections between different independent elementary controllers allowing them to self-align their own carrier regardless the number of actives cells.

ID GASOLINE BLEND
AB Ethanol-gasoline and butanol-gasoline blended fuel was tested in a conventional engine under various air-fuel equivalence ratios for its performance and emissions. The results of engine performance tests showed that torque output would increase slightly at seventy percent throttle valve opening when ethanol-gasoline and butanol-gasoline blended fuel was used. It was also shown that CO and HC emissions were reduced with the increase of ethanol/butanol content in the blended fuel, which resulted from oxygen enrichment. At an air-fuel equivalence ratio slightly larger than one, the smallest amounts of CO and HC and the largest amounts of CO2. resulted. It was noted that under the lean combustion condition, CO2. emission was controlled by air-fuel equivalence ratio; while under the rich combustion condition, CO2. emission is offset by CO emission. From the experimental data, the optimal ethanol, butanol content in the gasoline and air-fuel equivalence ratio in terms of engine performance and air pollution was found.

AB Latent Semantic Analysis or LSA uses a method of singular value decomposition of co-occurrence document-term matrix to derive a latent class model. Despite its success, there are some shortcomings in this technique. Recent works have improved the standard LSA using method of probability distribution, regularization, sparseness constraint. But there are still some other deficiencies. It is dealt with this paper, an adapted technique called hk-LSA based on reducing dimension of vector space and like-probabilistic relationships between document and latent-topic space is proposed. The adaptive technique overcomes some weak points of LSA such as processing density of orthogonal matrices, complexity in matrix decomposition, facing with alternative iteration algorithms, etc. The experiments show consistent and substantial improvements of the hk-LSA over LSA.

DE ILC; model control; Norm optimal ILC
AB Iterative learning control (ILC) is an approach suitable for systems which repeatedly perform a tracking task over a fixed time interval. However little attention has been paid to the case of multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) systems. In this paper theoretical results are derived and establish a close link between increased interaction, reduced robustness, slower convergence and greater control effort. Focusing on the popular class of norm optimal ILC (NOILC) algorithms, these findings are experimentally confirmed using a MIMO test facility which permits both exogenous disturbance injection and a variable level of coupling between input and output pairs. To address performance limitations 'point-to-point' NOILC is then introduced, in which the need to track the reference at all time points along the trial is relaxed.

   panels system
AB Nowadays, in the context of the demand for energy is growing by the day, the fossil energy sources are being depleted and environmental pollution problems caused by the exploitation and use of this energy resources is causing severe consequences for life on Earth, the development of renewable energy has become a strong trend throughout the world. In types of renewable energy sources, solar and wind energy are the two most potential renewable energy sources because they have greater availability in all areas and they should be able to exploit in various sizes and forms. However, a single renewable energy source system can't provide a continuous power because of difference of the weather condition of seasons. So, research and use a hybrid energy system is necessary. To exploit wind energy efficiently, design of the high-performance wind turbine's blade profiles is extremely important. To maintain the performance of the panels at the highest level we need a system of adjustable panels that are always facing the sun. This paper will show the design process of a hybrid energy system with a helical darrieus wind turbine and a sun tracking solar panels system. The purpose of this system is generating an uninterrupted power without damaging the nature, applying easily in areas where people do not have electricity grid and helping households in areas where people have electricity grid reduce the cost of electricity consumption. A hybrid energy system with calculated power 1136 Wh/day is designed.

DE air conditioning; underground water; heat conduction; iron roof sheets;
   solar radiation
AB In the summer, the outdoor temperature in the central part of Vietnam can be very high, reaching 34-35 degrees C and even more than 42 degrees C in some places. Hot climate makes a strong influence on animal organism; as a result, it reduces animal weight and/or quantity of eggs. Therefore, air conditioning is extremely needed in animal industries. There are several ways to cool the temperature, but each has its advantages and disadvantages. We propose to use underground water at the temperature of 24-25 degrees C for this purpose. One of methods of cooling sheds for animals is watering the roof. For calculating the amount of heat from the air inside the animal sheds transferred into the cooling water, we propose to approximatly calculate the amount of heat transferred from the air inside the sheds into the cooling water through corrugated panels of the corrugated iron roof sheets and neglect the influence of the heat transfer on the overlaps of the sheets. It appears that this method may contain errors. The authors solved the issue of cooling animal sheds by watering the roof by analytical method. Specifically, we solved the problem of heat conductivity of the fin having constant cross section along its finite length, wherein two sides of the blades surrounding by various environments. Additionally, the calculation considered the effect of solar radiation. For that purpose, the authors created a heat balance equation at steady state for any infinitesimal element of blades, after that we solved differential equation. The resulting solution of the special case completely coincided with the solution of the classical issue. The authors applied the results for calculating practical problems.

AB Absorption phenomenon of NH3 into NH3-H2O solution has analysed theoreticcally. The heat transfer coefficient obtained from the coupled heat and mass transfer mathematic model. This heat transfer coefficient is used to calculate the variation of the simulated value of heat load. The practical decrease of wetted ratio analyses were taken into account when the solution flow from the top to the bottom of the parallel tube bundle. The deviation of theoretical heat load and experimental heat load is about 10%. In addition heat transfer coefficient and mass transfer coefficient of the absorption process are agree well with other studies. A correlation which gives the heat transfer coefficient and mass transfer coefficient as funtions of the initial solution concentration, solution mass flow rate per unit tube length, and cooling water temperature are derived to estimate the absorber heat load and mass absorption flow rate of NH3 vapor into NH3H2O solution.

DE Model predictive control; dynamic matrix control; system identification;
   real-time window target
AB In this paper, a novel identification method is proposed on the basis of Dynamic Matrix Control (DMC) algorithm. The high order model of the system is first identified using continuous process model with time delay. The lower order model is then systematically obtained by considering some well-known approximation techniques. The DMC algorithm is developed to get an optimal control sequence for the linear model with a quadratic cost function. The process disturbance is also investigated to evaluate the quality of the controller. The control algorithms are programmed in the Matlab/Simulink software adopting Real-Time Window Target and a PCI card to execute in the real system. As a result, the proposed controller affords significantly the improvement of overall performance in compared with the classical PID controller for both the set-point and disturbance rejection problems.

DE Gas-Liquid Cylindrical Cyclone separator; GLCC; cyclone separator;
   multiphase flow; turbulence model
AB Gas-Liquid Cylindrical Cyclone (GLCC) separator is widely used in the petroleum industry with potential fields of applications. Its performance is strongly influenced by the inlet configuration thus the importance of the behavior of flow in the GLCC and the effects of different geometrical configurations for enhancing its separation are interested in this paper. The main goal of this paper is the deep studying of the effect of different inlet configurations of the performances of GLCC by method 3D CFD simulation. Four different inlets configurations with the inclined angle of 27 degrees and the same cross-sectional nozzle area of about 25% of the area of the cylinder have constructed, namely: (1) one circular inlet, (2) two circular inlets, (3) one taper square reduced nozzle inlet and (4) two taper square reduced nozzle inlets. Axial and tangential velocity of flow across the GLCC diameter are measured at 3 different axial locations (x=-200mm above the inlet; x=200mm and 300mm below the inlet). Two of flow rates are selected to investigate the effect of flow rate (Reynolds number) on the flow behavior. As a result, we propose the use of two taper square reduced nozzle inlets to enhance the separation efficiency because of their effects.

AB Chemical enhancing adhesion properties of Wood-Plastic Composite (WPC) has been strongly negative affected to human life. The disadvantages of the currently treatment system are low treatment efficiency, costly and unstable due to using combining physics and chemistry methods. In this study, the adhesion wood-plastic composite in line production system using plasma at atmospheric pressure was designed and developed to solve the above disadvantages. The before and after treating, the percentage of area removed of samples were measured by Elcometer 107 Cross Hatch Cutter and ImageJ software for adhesion evolution. Applied power, carrier speed and treatment cycle times were used for analyzing the adhesion efficiency. The results showed that applied power and treatment cycle time are strongly effect to adhesion efficiency. Moreover, carrier speed is also effective. The treatment efficiency leads to higher than 3B standard at applied power 156W, 750mm/min and three treatment times.

AB This paper presented an experimental comparison between a microchannel cooler and two conventional coolers of a CO2 air conditioning cycle. The conventional coolers and the microchannel cooler were designed to have the same heating capacity; however, the volume of the microchannel cooler is less than conventional coolers. The results indicated that the heat transfer efficiency of the microchannel cooler is higher than those of conventional cooler. However, when cooler pressure was over 100 bar, the microchannel cooler was torn. So, the microchannel cooler should be used at the cooler pressure under 75 bar. In addition, the cycle performed at the evaporative temperature of 9 degrees C, calculating the COP of 6.6 (negligible heat transfer rate of subcooling process). The COP of present study is higher than those obtained from other literature reviews.

AB The waste water has been strongly negative affected to human life in large area, especially wastewater from laboratory because of a lot of chemicals and bacteria. The disadvantages of the currently state are the using treatment systems with low treatment efficiency, costly and unstable due to using microbiological, biochemistries, combining physical chemistry method, or advanced oxidation process. In this study, the treatment wastewater from laboratory using plasma at low temperature and at atmospheric pressure was designed and developed to solve the above disadvantages. An 80 l/h treatment system was completed and assembled in the Dong Thap Experiment Technique and Applying Science Technology Center DOTAST to test and evaluate the treatment efficiency. In order to prove the stability of the processing system, before and after treating, water samples were collected and tested by the DOTAST at various times. The results showed that treatment efficiency reached to 70-90% and satisfy QCVN 40:2011/BTNMT column A. The system is stable, compact, automated and saving energy.

AB Ultrasonic welding of carbon paper and proton exchange membrane (PEM) for membrane exchange assemblies (MEAs) of fuel cells (FCs) is a viable technology to replace hot-pressing, which may be time consuming and energy inefficient. Ultrasonic spot welding of carbon paper and PEM is investigated in order to understand the bonding mechanisms and obtain the suitable processing parameters. Micrographs of the tested specimens are examined to evaluate the welding quality. Effects of the welding time on the quality of the ultrasonic welds of the MEAs are studied. It is found that joints made by ultrasonic welding has the strength comparable to that of the base material. Values of welding time, holding time and downward force for successful bonding in terms of mechanical strength are obtained.

AB In this research, we present a framework for industrial measurement using 3D scanning technology. Until recently, metal parts with glossy surfaces still pose a big challenge for low dynamic range CMOS sensor in 3D scanner. Several approaches have partially solved this problem either by trading off scanning time or by increasing system's complexity. Unfortunately, these methods defeat the "low cost" and "fast" advantages of structured light scanning. In our framework, we employ several strategies such as: utilize smart encoding schemes for better signal-to-noise ratio, dynamically adjust the projector to minimize specular light, utilize multiple cameras and customized algorithms to shorten processing time. As a result, our setup greatly improves measurement quality while only incur a small time and monetary cost.

DE Thixoforming; Deform 3D; Mold Design; Pressing Speed
AB The thixoforming process is becoming more and more important in the field of metal-forming. In this process, the most difficult part is heating the sample while keeping the temperature uniform. The pressing speed is one of the main parameters that impacts strongly on product quality. In this paper, the mold for studying the effect of pressing speed was designed and manufactured. The Deform 3D software was applied for observing the relationship between the pressing speed and the force history, stress, and temperature distribution. The results show that a pressing speed of v = 8 mm/s results in the smallest stress. The stress depends on many elements. For example, the pressing speed of v = 6 mm/s makes the heating process happen fast. The billet is cooled faster so the stress increases and even changes the structure unexpectedly. When the pressing speed is too high, the metal on the surface of the billet flows with high speed so it collides with the folding segments causing great resistance thus creating high stress.

AB The conventional chemical bonding of shoes surface before pasting in shoes manufacturing process has been strongly negative affected to human life, not only in manufacturing process but also in wearing shoes. The disadvantages of the currently treatment system are low treatment efficiency, costly and extremely toxic because of using chemical method. In this study, the bonding shoes surface in production line using plasma at atmospheric pressure was designed and developed to solve the above disadvantages. Optimal plasma module and a machinery principle were studied base on analysis and experiment from various design options. The factors which influence to bonding efficiency are treatment speed, the number of treatment times, applied current and shoes type were studied. The results show that applied current is the crucial parameter that decides the bonding efficiency; the higher applied current the higher bonding efficiency. In three months at the industrial testing, the system is considered as a high effective system, 150 percent of capacity increasing, 4 workers decreasing, and especially green technology. At the end of the project, an operating guide, an optimize treatment parameters for various type of shoes were set up for inline production.

AB Determining suitable biomass particle size and pyrolysis time plays a crucial role in designing and improvement the performance of biomass fast pyrolysis in fluidized bed reactors for bio-oils production. Current numerical modelling investigations has not dealt with the particle sizes and fast pyrolysis time. In this paper, analytical methods were applied to investigate unsteady temperature fields and the relationship between residence time and particle sizes for fast pyrolysis of bagasse and wood in the fluidized bed reactor. Mathematical model based on well-known heat conduction equations was developed in the MATLAB to simulate unsteady temperature fields and investigate the impacts of particles sizes on the residence time. The results shown that active pyrolysis begins occurring between 230 degrees C to 300 degrees C depending on the reactor temperature. Particle sizes and types of biomass have significant impact of the residence time of fast pyrolysis. According to the study, the maximum radius of bagasse and wood particles for fast pyrolysis is 2.25 mm and 1 mm respectively at 500 degrees C of reactor temperature.

AB This research proposes a combined-drying system as a design solution to improve the performance of conventional solar drying systems in terms of the uniformity of taste and humidity remain in dried crops thanking to controlled and stabilized drying parameters. The design is an active solar drying type in which the even distribution of hot air flow over the crops is emphasized and made possible by a special chamber geometrical structure; and drying parameters including chamber indoor temperature; humidity and air velocity are controlled within specific value ranges by a relevant automatic control system. Three kinds of crops, including jackfruit, banana and bitter-melon have been tested. Results have shown that the design actually maintained well the set values of drying temperature and air flow rate while the chamber's structure did help distribute the heat evenly on the crops. The taste of the dried crops was practically examined by experts and confirmed to be excellent, and humidity remain in the crops was quite uniform with only 1.5% difference maximum. Besides, although daily weather condition does affect on the contribution of the absorbed solar energy, in the testing condition, it contributed around 59% of the total energy consumption.

AB This paper presents a method of estimating the speed of an induction motor Luenberger. This method is based on speed sensorless estimation of vector controlled induction motor drive and adaptive control theory. A flux observer of an induction motor with a parameter adaptive scheme will be proposed. The parameters identified adaptively are stator and rotor resistance. A stability of the proposed adaptive flux observer will be proved by the Lyapunov's theorem. An adaptive scheme can be applied also to estimate motor speed without speed sensors. The theoretical basis of indirect field oriented vector control is explained in detail and it is implemented in Matlab, Simulink. Furthermore, experimental results of an indirect field-oriented induction motor control without speed sensor using DSP 1104 card are presented. Simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the principles and demonstrate the practicality of the approach. Those results are obtained under the condition that the motor parameters used in the observer are correct.

AB In this paper, the structure of indirect matrix converter (IMC) is presented and the space vector pulse width modulation method (SVPWM) is analyzed to apply for this converter. The advantage point of IMC is directly connected a load to a three-phase power source using six bidirectional switches and twelve unidirectional switches without using any intermediate energy storage element. IMC stands out with low input harmonic, while compact design. The main study idea is combining between an IMC and a dual two-level inverter for an open-end winding load to enhance the converter output quality as well as kept the IMCs advantage. The SVPWM is sequentially analyzed for rectifier and inverter stage to generate the switching pattern for the converter. Finally, experiment result is shown to demonstrate the reality of topology.

AB This work develops a technique to design a feedback stabilizing control law for an unstable autonomous switched system. This method is analyzed and then applied to the DCDC buck converter when considering the uncertainty of the parameters in the model. Based on this model, a control law is design to allow the output voltage track a reference voltage when the load is changed. The control objective is to find the switching strategy where the state of the system converges to the equilibrium in the presence of the uncertainty of the system. The design problem is cast into an optimization problem which can be solved via the LMI toolbox in Matlab. The tracking error is bounded in a certain region. The simulation results using Simulink in Matlab are presented to validate the capability of the control system.

AB Almost controllers of induction motor speed are designed to keep motor speed unchanged. It is hard for conventional controller such as PI controller because induction motor is a nonlinear system with parameter changes and noise. Sliding mode control based on reference model is worth trying to overcome that difficulty. This paper presents a new method using sliding mode controller based on reference model and stator field orientation for an induction motor. There are two separate sliding mode controllers are designed. The first one is for control of the flux field and the second for the torque of the motor. A reference model is properly chosen to estimate reference speed of the motor. A seven level cascade inverter is control to reduce common - mode voltage which will improve the stability for proposed controllers. The method used to reduce chattering around sliding surfaces is also presented. Simulation and experimental results on a 1-hp 150-rad/sec squirrel-rotor induction motor shows smooth operation of the control scheme with a 1.5 times increase of the stator resistor and rotor resistor values of the induction motor under condition of noises. The performances of the sliding mode controllers are compared with a PI (Proportional and Integral) controllers with various load conditions.

AB This paper presents the development of velocity time measuring system for motorcycles and the potential of proposing a driving cycle for motorcycles in Ho Chi Minh City. Motorcycles are the major mean of transport, but they are also the main source of air pollution in the biggest cities in Vietnam. Nowadays, the high levels offuel consumption and air pollution are the most important problems that characterized the urban areas of both developed and developing countries. In this work, a velocity-time measuring system is developed for tracking the change of velocity as a function of time. This system is studied using (1) Velocity sensor: magnetic type converted analog signal to digital/pulse signal sending to Arduino circuit; (2) Accelerator sensor: measured accelerator for three axis (x, y, z) and sending to Arduino via standard of I2C; (3) Arduino: receiving and processing the measured signal and communicating smart phone via Bluetooth; (4) Smart phone/receiver using android operating system: receiving the signal via Bluetooth and estimating the concerned parameters and monitoring the measured/estimated results. The preliminary results are useful to evaluate for better understanding the current status and further development for driving cycle for motorcycle.

DE Photo voltaic (PV) emulator; digital control
AB This paper presents a DSP- and DC-DC converter-based photovoltaic (PV) emulator which can simulate the output characteristic of a real PV module. The control mechanism is a combination of the current mode controller with a modified look up table of PV module characteristic which generates the reference current based on the measurement of converter output voltage and current. A prototype of the PV emulator is built to validate the proposed control method. The experimental results shows that the designed PV emulator has a fast transient response as well as steady state operating points well fitted with theoretical characteristic.

DE Active power filter; current source; predictor algorithm
AB A current-source active power filter (CS-APF) always has an LC filter at its output to remove switching ripple in its compensating current. However, the cutoff frequency of this LC filter also limits the control bandwidth as well as increases the order of the CS-APF current control loop. This issue combining with the inevitable time delay in the DSP-based controller applied to the CS-APF make the actual compensating current always significantly lagged behind the reference current, resulting in the severe degrade of the CSAPF performance. In case the nonlinear load is of periodical type, this paper presents a predictor algorithm to compensate the phase lag to improve the dynamic performance of the CS-APF. Simulation results in different operating conditions are presented to validate the proposed approach.

AB This paper presents an approach to diagnose batteries with the help of microcontroller and smartphone. It aims to determine the available capacity, the state of charge (SoC) and the state of health (SoH) of a battery. A battery is aged by charging and discharging cycles, this process degrades the chemical composition of the battery. Thus, this paper aims at using two-pulse test to determine Ampere hour capacity (AHC), SoC and SoH of a valve regulated lead acid (VRLA). These parameters are related to the voltage drop after each pulse of current discharge. By using a microcontroller and smartphone, it is possible to easily change the controller parameters according to different size of battery. The microcontroller will be used to control current discharge based on two-pulse method and a discrete PID. A smartphone with an application based on Android program and via Bluetooth communication allows to change the parameters for the controller and monitor the performance of battery test. This concept is validated by simulations and experiments on an emulated system for availability reasons. This work takes place in a larger process which aims at providing local solutions for local problems according to the "Jugaad" philosophy, which can be seen as "frugal innovation". The main idea is to re-use "old" elements such as automotive batteries in this case, to propose cheap and local solutions for off-grid village electrification.

AB This paper concerntrates on the analysis, design and control methodology in the machining servo system. The overall architecture of motion system is investigated to realize the drawbacks of traditional scheme. Then, this research proposes the suitable design of controller due to rapid calculation, high precision and friendly graphical user interface. The diagram of Fuzzy self-tuning PID and feed-forward is constructed to drive the servo machine. The hardware platform of controller has been accomplised such as schematic, PCB artworks and soldering. Later, the middleware and firmware have been closed to promote the execution between controller and computer. The intelligent algorithm is embedded in board level by TMS320C6727 to overcome the problems, for example the existing nonlinear properties, external disturbances or servo lag phenomena. Based on the theoretical design, several simulation results are provided to verify the contributions. From the experimental performance, it can be seen clearly that this controller smoothly manipulate the servo motor, ensure real-time performance and high tracking position.

AB Linear motors have many advantages in compare with rotary motors due to directly creating linear motion without gears or belts,... It is hard to apply the online model predictive controller for electro-mechanism systems with input, output and state constraints because it requires the good ability in calculations of microcontroller and the nonlinear property of these models. In this paper, the exact linearization is applied to obtain the corresponding linear model and we propose the offline model predictive control law based on multi-parametric programming (MPP) for permanent magnet linear synchronous motors (PMLSM) to remarkably reduce amount of calculation. Thus, it is convenient for embedding the control law into microcontroller. Several simulation results show the ability of the proposed method in this paper.

AB The paper is to present an approach to including the importance of symptoms to a fuzzy rule based expert system combining positive and negative knowledge for medical consultations. We describe the rule base consisting of positive fuzzy rule for confirmation of conclusion and negative fuzzy rules for exclusion of conclusion with degrees of importance of symptoms. We also propose extend Max-Min inference systems by adding t-norm for calculating degrees of importance of symptoms. To combining positive and negative knowledge, an ordered Albelian group operation is applied. Based on this approach, the system can adapt more with real clinical application of medical consultation. Some examples to show the advantage of this approach are presented.

AB In this paper, a novel approach is introduced for tracking human targets in cases of high influence from complexity of environment. In real world applications, the need of interaction in real time between a tracking system and human plays an important role. In the proposed approach, a RGB-D camera is utilized to acquire the depth information which is considered to define the Depth Of Interest (DOI). This DOI is used to combine with the CAM-shift algorithm in human tracking. The Kalman filter is also implemented to help in predicting the direction of target. Comparing with the original CAM-shift algorithm, our approach performs more accurate and more effective results. The experiment results also show that our system can be implemented for real-time applications as well.

DE Breath detection; inspiratory phase; respiratory phase; detect
   respiration; Lucas-Kanade Algorithm; deepest inspiration
AB A simple and economical system is developed to detect human breath in a real time fashion with a normal webcam. By using the optical flow method, a novel approach is proposed to detect the peak of inspiratory phase from a series of frames that are captured from a camera to define the time for trigging X-ray shooting. The issue of using images to detect breath is that the motions of respiratory features on chest are very small, since the camera is attached on the X-ray machine with a significant distance. Therefore, the Lucas-Kanade algorithm is considered to track small motions on chest. Adaboost and corner detection are developed to identify region of chest and to obtain useful feature points for the LucasKanade algorithm. From the experimental conducted, by using the proposed approach, the motion of respiratory phase is easily observed and the predictive error of the peak time is about 0.488 second, approximately 9.75% of the averaging breath cycle. It is acceptable for the X-ray shooting purpose.

AB In this paper, a detailed study to apply an adaptive proportional-derivative networks (APDNs) tracking control is proposed for redundant parallel manipulators with full-state constraints. APDNs is designed - based on the combination of the nonlinear compensation, the PD nonlinear sliding part, and feedforward radial basic function neural networks (RBFNs) with online learning. By using the Lyapunov method, the stability of the closed-loop system in the case of full-state constraints is proven. The proposed control strategy has better dynamic performance and higher robustness in comparison with PD-sliding mode control and augmented nonlinear PD control. The effectiveness proposed control is illustrated by simulation.

AB Nowadays, thanks to the great advances in energy technology, renewable energy has grown and become an indispensable part of the power system. However, the dependence on the natural elements of this form of energy causes the output parameters to become unstable: voltage, power, etc. Therefore, the integration of DC-DC power converters becomes necessary to meet voltage stability and conversion efficiency. This paper investigates the effect of elements in the Boost and Buck DC / DC converters by using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) control method. The method of calculating the circuit element is given, results indicate the advantages and disadvantages of the circuit when operating with different sets of parameters and the stability of the converter.

AB Wireless sensor networks have emerged as the major criteria that enable the Internet of things evolution. They have wide application range from special domain to civilian and scientific domain thus it is attracted a lot of research. Since security is of the crucial importance of wireless sensor networks, there are existed several authentication techniques for digital right management, and watermarking is a promising approach for ensuring a part of communication security in these networks due to its popular use and lightweight. Watermarking values can be constructed from authentication information to validate sensory data and detect where the data has been altered. In this paper, we propose a novel method to create watermarked data by utilizing natural movement characteristic of Brownian motion node which plays a role as the agent node. Moreover, watermark detection probability of traditional watermarking techniques is evaluated by numerical results to show the proposal efficiency.

AB This paper deals with the influence of IDT (interdigitated transducer) structure and input signal on responses of passive wireless sensor SAW (Surface Acoustic Wave). We used simulation software based on finite element method (FEM) with %Z-LiNbO3 piezoelectric substation has 80 pm thickness, 3 reflectors, material of the reflecting bar is Al and the structure of IDT is SPUDT (single-phase unidirectional transducers). Firstly, the number of aluminum bars in the reflective grating are 4. The results show the amplitude of the reflected wave is greatest with the IDT number of 50. When we increase the input signal, the amplitude of the response increasing. In addition, the amplitude of the reflected wave front the first reflector increase with increasing the number of bar in reflective grating.

AB Software defined networking (SDN) technology promises a new bright future to IP network. Significant number of SDN researches have been done so far to facilitate network operation and management efficiently. However, until now there are only few frameworks to support emulation, verification, and implementation of the SDN. Mininet is one of the most popular tools because of the openness, cost effectiveness, and full Openflow support. By default, Mininet helps to create a stand alone typical SDN network along with lightweight clients. In this article, we contribute the extended functions of network topology emulation in Mininet based on Virtualbox, such as Internet connection, independent OS clients, standard routing controller, and automatic flow logging. It is highly expected to bring an easier and convenient facility to SDN research and training.

AB In many real-life recommendation settings, user profiles and past activities are not available. The recommender system should make predictions based on session data, e.g. session clicks and descriptions of clicked items. Conventional recommendation approaches, which rely on past user-item interaction data, cannot deliver accurate results in these situations. In this paper, we describe a method that combines session clicks and content features such as item descriptions and item categories to generate recommendations. To model these data, which are usually of different types and nature, we use 3-dimensional convolutional neural networks with character-level encoding of all input data. While 3D architectures provide a natural way to capture spatio-temporal patterns, character-level networks allow modeling different data types using their raw textual representation, thus reducing feature engineering effort. We applied the proposed method to predict add-to-cart events in e-commerce websites, which is more difficult then predicting next clicks. On two real datasets, our method outperformed several baselines and a state-of-the-art method based on recurrent neural networks.

AB In this paper, we tackle advantages of cyclical movement patterns of hand gestures. The cyclical patterns are defined as closed-form which hand moves away from a rest position, follows one or more of a series of the movement of hand shapes and returns to its rest position. Due to the cyclical pattern characteristic, phase of gestures are supportive cues for deploying robust recognition schemes. We conduct a spatial-temporal representation of the hand gestures which takes into account both hand shapes and its movements during a gesture. The phase alignment then is deployed in the conducted space. The proposed scheme ensures inter-period phase continuity as well as normalizes length of the hand gestures. Three different datasets of dynamic hand gestures consisting of non-cyclical and cyclical patterns are examined. Evaluation results confirm that the best accuracy rate achieves at 96% for cyclical pattern that is significantly higher than results for typical gestures. The proposed method suggests a feasible and robust solution addressing technical issues in developing human-computer interaction applications such as using hand gestures to control home appliance devices.

AB Precise positioning plays a key role in successful navigation of autonomous vehicles. A fusion architecture of Global Positioning System (GPS) and Laser-SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is widely adopted. While Laser-SLAM is known for its highly accurate localization, GPS is still required to overcome accumulated error and give SLAM a required reference coordinate. However, there are multiple cases where GPS signal quality is too low or not available such as in multi-story parking, tunnel or urban area due to multipath propagation issue etc. This paper proposes an alternative approach for these areas with WiFi Fingerprinting technique to replace GPS. Result obtained from WiFi Fingerprinting will then be fused with Laser-SLAM to maintain the general architecture, allow seamless adaptation of vehicle to the environment.

AB Vehicular network can improve traffic safety by exchange of safety-related messages between the vehicles within the the neighborhood of each other. However, many research related to vehicular network depends heavily on system-level simulation. In this paper, we use tools from stochastic geometry to analyze the reliability of the transmission of periodic message in a highway scenario. A Poission point process (PPP) based-based network and slotted-aloha MAC scheme is assumed. Three-slope pass loss and rayleigh-lognormal fading are taken into consideration. Coverage probability and packet reception rate (PRR) are adopt as the reliability metrics. We then derive the closed form expressions of coverage probability and PRR. Finally, the accuracy of the analysis is validated via simulation.

AB Decomposition of working brain into meaningful clusters of regions is an important step to understand brain functionality. Blind source separation algorithms can achieve this, which results in diverse outcomes dependent upon underlying assumptions of the decomposition algorithm in use. The conventional data-driven method to detect brain functional networks is the Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The ICA method assumes decomposed components are statistically independent of each other. However, such a mathematical assumption is physiologically uncertain in regard to its applications to functional MRI (fMRI) studies. A recently proposed MCA-KSVD method, which stands for Morphological Component Analysis implemented using a K-SVD algorithm, relaxes the independence assumption imposed by the ICA method. In this study, a comprehensive comparison between the conventional ICA and MCA-KSVD methods was conducted in the presence of various simulated noise conditions. Experimental results showed that in a task-related fMRI experiment, the MCA-KSVD method successfully identified same networks as those detected by the ICA method and had advantages of better signal localization and spatial resolution. However, improper choices of the sparsity parameter and the number of trained atoms introduced phenomena, namely signal leakage, signal splitting and signal ambiguity. The MCA-KSVD method could be used as an alternative or in parallel with the ICA method, but with careful consideration of model parameter selection.

DE Sensitive document detection; document embedding; Doc2Vec; automatic
   query expansion; data leakage prevention
AB Document sensitivity classification is essential to prevent potential sensitive data leakage for individuals and organizations. As most of existing methods use regular expressions or data fingerprinting to classify sensitive documents, they may not fully exploit the semantic and content of a document, especially with informal messages and files. This motivates the authors to propose a novel method to classify document sensitivity in realtime with better semantic and content analysis.
   Taking advantages of deep learning in natural language processing, we use our pre-trained Twitter-based document embedding TD2V to encode a document or a text fragment into a fixed length vector of 300 dimensions. Then we use retrieval and automatic query expansion to retrieve a re-ranked list of semantically similar known documents, and determine the sensitivity score for a new document from those of the retrieved documents in this list. Experimental results show that our method can achieve classification accuracy of more than 99.9% for 4 datasets (snowden, Mormon, Dyncorp, TM) and 98.34% for Enron dataset. Furthermore, our method can early predict a sensitive document from a short text fragment with the accuracy higher than 98.84%.

ID AUTHENTICATION
AB Gait recognition has been considered as a new promising approach for biometric-based authentication. Gait signals are commonly obtained by collecting motion data from inertial sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes) integrated in mobile and wearable devices. Motion data is subsequently transformed to a feature space for recognition procedure. One fashionable, effective way to extract features automatically is using conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as feature extractors.
   In this paper, we propose DeepSense-Inception (DSI), a new method inspired from DeepSense, to recognize users from their gait features using Inception-like modules for better feature extraction than conventional CNN. Experiments for user identification on UCI Human Activity Recognition dataset demonstrate that our method not only achieves an accuracy of 99.9%, higher than that of DeepSense (99.7%), but also uses only 149K parameters, less than one third of the parameters in DeepSense (529K parameters). Thus, our method can be implemented more efficiently in limited resource systems.

AB The existing studies of the interpretability of fuzzy systems have mainly focused on the analysis of the relation between a model of the fuzzy system and a human user considered as a beneficiary, i.e., a domain expert or a designer. Suggested by the concepts of "model" of formalized theories, "realization" of formalized language, and "interpretability" of a theory in another, the main contribution of this paper is the proposal of a new approach to the fuzzy system interpretability. This is grounded on the qualitative real-world semantics of words and relationships between the semantics of fuzzy system components and substructures of their real-world counterparts. Thus, we introduce a novel real-world-semantics-based approach. It is aimed at characterizing the so-called real-world-semantics-based interpretability of fuzzy systems. In addition, it considers the actual semantics of all fuzzy system components, including the inference engine. Moreover, this new approach opens the door to a new way to study the interpretability of fuzzy systems.

AB In this paper, we propose a neutrosophic recommender system for medical diagnosis using both neutrosophic similarity measure and neutrosophic clustering to capture the treatment of similar patients at different levels within a concurrent group. The proposed algorithm allows similar patients being treated concurrently in a group. Firstly, the similarities are measured based on the algebraic operations and their theoretic properties. Secondly, a clustering algorithm is used to identify neighbors that are in the same cluster and share common characteristics. Then, a prediction formula using results of both the clustering algorithm and the similarity measures is designed. Experiment indicates the advantages and superiority of the proposal.

ID MODE CONTROL
AB An optimal fuzzy disturbance observer-enhanced sliding mode controller (FDO-SMC) for magneto-rheological damper (MRD)-based semi-active train-car suspensions (MRD-TSs) subjected uncertainty and disturbance (UAD) whose variability rate may be high but bounded is proposed. The two main parts of the FDO-SMC are an adaptive sliding mode controller (aSMC) and an optimal fuzzy disturbance observer (oFDO). First, initial structures of the sliding mode controller (SMC) and disturbance observer (DO) are built. Adaptive update laws for the SMC and DO are then set up synchronously via Lyapunov stability analysis with a used parameter constraint mechanism. An optimal fuzzy system (oFS) is designed to implement fully the constraint mechanism so as to guarantee for the stable converging to the desired state even if the UAD variability rate increases in a given range. As a result, the aSMC and the oFDO are created from the SMC and DO. The compared simulation surveys reflected that the positive competence to stamp out and isolate vibration with the lower consumed power is the main advantage of the proposed controller.

AB The fuzzy co-clustering algorithms are considered as effective technique for clustering the complex data, such as high-dimensional and large size. In general, features of data objects are considered the same importance. However, in reality, the features have different roles in data analyses; even some of them are considered redundancy in the individual case for data sets. Removing these features is a way for the dimensionality reduction, which needs to improve the performance of data processing algorithms. In this paper, we proposed an improved fuzzy co-clustering algorithm called feature-reduction fuzzy co-clustering (FRFCoC), which can automatically calculate the weight of features and put them out of the data processing. We considered the objective function of the FCoC algorithm with feature-weighted entropy and build a learning procedure for components of the objective function, then reducing the dimension of data by eliminating irrelevant features with small weights. Experiments were conducted on synthetic data sets and hyperspectral image using the robust assessment indexes. Experimental results demonstrated the proposed algorithm outperformed the previous algorithms.

AB The authors are developing a talking robot which is a mechanical vocalization system modeling the human articulatory system. The talking robot is constructed with mechanical parts that are made by referring to human vocal organs biologically and functionally. In this study, a newly redesigned artificial vocal cords is developed for the purpose of extending the speaking capability of the talking robot. The artificial vocal cords is developed using functional approach. A thin layer of rubber band with a width of 7mm is attached on a plastic body in a sealed chamber creates an artificial sound source. The fundamental frequency of the sound source vary from 80Hz to 250 Hz depending on the pressure to the rubber band and the curving shape of the rubber band. The curving shape of the rubber band is adjustable by an innovative design mechanism driven by a servo motor. The amount of air pressure applied to the rubber band is controlled by another servo motor. The experiments to verify the speak capability of the talking robot with this newly redesigned vocal cords is conducted by letting the robot generating five vowel sounds with different combinations of 20 levels of rubber band shape and 5 levels of air pressure input. The pitch of each sound is extracted to determine the effect of the rubber band shape and the pressure input on the output sound. The result shows that this newly redesigned vocal cords greatly increase the speaking capability of the talking robot, especially its singing performance.

AB In this paper we propose a novel context-aware algorithm for hand poses classifying. The proposed algorithm based on Viola-Jones method, wavelet transforms, PCA and neural networks. At first, the Viola-Jones method is used to find the location of hand pose in images. Then the features of hand pose are extracted using combination of wavelet transform and PCA. Finally, these extracted features are classified by multi-layer feedforward neural networks. In this proposed algorithm, for each training hand pose we create one neural network, which will determine whether an input hand pose is training hand pose or not. In order to test the proposed algorithm, we use known Cambridge Gesture database and divide it into 5 parts with difference light contrast conditions. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm effectively classifies the hand pose in difference light contrast conditions and competes with state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB The resource management on cloud computing is a major challenge. Resource management in cloud computing environment can be divided into two phases: resource provisioning and resource scheduling. In this paper, we propose VM provision solution ensure to balance the goals of the party stakeholders including service providers and customers based on game theory. The optimal or near optimal solution is approximated by meta-heuristic algorithm - Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based on Nash equilibrium. In the experiments, the Ant System, Max-Min Ant System, Ant Colony System algorithm are applied to solve the game. The simulation results show how to use the coefficients to achieve load balancing in VM provision. These coefficients depend on objectives of cloud computing service providers.

AB The problem of minimum distance localization in environments that may contain self-similarities is addressed. A mobile robot is placed at an unknown location inside a 2D self-similar polygonal environment P. The robot has a map of P and can compute visibility data through sensing. However, the self-similarities in the environment mean that the same visibility data may correspond to several different locations. The goal, therefore, is to determine the robot's true initial location while minimizing the distance traveled by the robot. We consider approximation algorithm for the robot localization problem. The algorithm is based on triangulation of a simple polygon representing a map. Based on the basis of the implemented program, we conducted experimental studies of this algorithm. The numerical results and their interpretation are better than others.

AB Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a challenging research topic in tracking a person's state of motion and interaction with the surroundings. HAR plays an important role in developing many applications helping improve quality of life. Applications based on HAR could be used in checking the state of health, identifying a mobile phone's context, keeping track of user's physical activities, etc. In this research, we applied Recursive Feature Elimination based on Linear Discrimination Analysis (RFELDA) to (http://topepo.github.io/caret/rfe.html#rfe) reduce the dimensionality of dataset before applying classification algorithms to assign subject's activities. The experiment results on dataset showed that RFELDA improved performance and reduced processor time better than original dataset did.

ID CACHE
AB Nowadays, Content Centric Networking (CCN) could be the future Internet architecture for its advance feature: In-network caching due to cheaper to cache than to transmit contents nowadays. Besides, the popularity of content in CCN gives much challenge to researchers, but there are a few solutions for that, such as LCD (Leave Copy Down). LCD policy is known as simple and effective caching mechanism so far. This work presents a new way of cooperation between CCN nodes in caching mechanism. Our caching mechanism is an optimization of LCD that some CCN nodes can help the others for their work on caching decision policy. This cooperation method doesn't require both additional signaling packet and much computation resource to work. Experiments show that this optimization in terms of cache hit can achieve better than convention LCD does. In additional, our solution is simple and very low overhead.

AB The data visualization enables users to contribute their knowledge and experience to the analysis of data stored in storages or resulted from collecting systems in real time. Visual techniques displaying data table as 2D or 3D charts, pies, lines, and so on, do not completely enable to explore multivariable data. Multivariate cube is modified from parallel coordinates by rotating the reference axis to the direction perpendicular to parallel coordinates plane. Multivariate cube represents multivariable data to enable users to answer elementary tasks in visual analytics by associating a point with its references on axes of 3-dimensional coordinates. Multivariate cube represents visually multivariable data to enable users to answer synoptic tasks in visual analytics by viewing the variation of data along the reference axis for each variable, or viewing the correlation between variables on the plane being perpendicular to and moving along the reference axis. Multivariate cube is illustrated in this paper with two case studies for visual analytics, the evaluation of learning outcomes of a program of higher education and the happenings of a disease.

DE Refactoring; Design patterns; Consistency; ARTC
AB Code refactoring is a technique that improves the existing code in order to make software easier to understand and more extensible without changing the external behavior. Software design patterns, programming language independent reusable solutions to comment problems, are well-known in Java communities. On one hand, the refactoring using design patterns brings many benefits such as cost saving, flexibilities, and maintainability. On the other hand, it potentially causes bugs or changes execution behavior of Java programs. This paper proposes a new approach to checking behavior preservation properties of Java programs after applying design patterns. We present new definitions to compute pre/post conditions of program behavior. In the next step, the paper makes use of Java Modeling Language (JML) to represent and check if the refactored program neglects to preserve the external behavior. A motivating example of Adaptive Road Traffic Control (ARTC) is given to illustrate the approach in detail.

DE GUI specification; Event-B; Android applications
AB In recent years, the number of Android smartphones increase dramatically and new applications are added numerously in Google store. Android developers usually have to deal with the difficulties such as limited capacity battery, screen design, and limited resources. Among them, specifying graphical user interfaces (GUI) of an application is one of the most important issues. This paper presents a new method to analyze GUI specifications of an Android application. We employ Event-B formal method and its refinement mechanism to formalize the specifications and to check if the constraints are satisfied. A running example of a Note application is given to illustrate the proposed method in detail.

AB Joining two time series on subsequence correlation provides useful information about the synchronization of the time series. However, finding the exact subsequence which are most correlated is an expensive computational task. Although the current efficient exact method, JOCOR, requires O(n(2)lgn), where n is the length of the time series, it is still very time-consuming even for time series datasets with medium length. In this paper, we propose an approximate method, LCS-JOCOR, in order to reduce the runtime of JOCOR. Our proposed method consists of three steps. First, two original time series are transformed into two corresponding strings by PAA transformation and SAX discretization. Second, we apply an algorithm to efficiently find the longest common substrings (LCS) of two strings. Finally, the resulting LCSs are mapped back to the original time series to find the most correlated subsequence by JOCOR method. In comparison to JOCOR, our proposed method performs much faster while high accuracy is guaranteed.

AB The global IT development is becoming ever more dominant. Notwithstanding, most of the projects of IS are not satisfied - the IS projects are still experiencing failure. This research reviews the IS project success with the multi-dimensional and multi-level approaches. Various works in academic journals and conferences from 1992 to 2016 were elaborated. The findings indicate that empirical studies are crucial. Interestingly, a mutual relationship between three themes of works (project success, IS success, and acceptance and use of technology) has been identified. Consequently, a conceptual framework provides the comprehensive explanation for IS project success is shown, which could be a promising avenue of IS research.

DE Blood cells; Echinocyte; Top-hat transform
AB In diagnostic of hematology, one of a most important informations is to infer about echinocyte presence. The top-hat transform and its application on echinocyte detection were briefly introducted in [2]. This paper suggests a new improvement based on random method to reduce number of computation for above purpose. We explain the relation between an upper bound of number of the blood cells to perform top-hat transform and number of echinocyte in image.

DE Personalized email prioritization; Email user action; SpamAssassin
AB Email overload, even after spam filtering, causes waste of time and reduction of work efficiency to email users. Email prioritization is the general solution for the problem. The idea is to sort incoming emails in a decreasing order of importance so that the most important messages are read and processed first and less significant ones later, if there is enough time. This paper proposed a method to predict the action that a user would take on an email. The method is based on SpamAssassin, a famous spam filter framework. Instead of classifying emails as spam and ham (non-spam message), this method is used to predict amongst the three most common actions: reply, read and delete. Experiments are conducted to measure the effectiveness of the new method on a dataset built by the authors.

DE Cloud computing; Resource allocation; Heterogeneous distributed
   platforms; Deadlock avoidance
AB This paper, presents an deadlock avoidance for model V VM-out-of-N PM. Algorithm used to reschedule the policies of resource supply for resource allocation on heterogeneous distributed platform. In the current scenario, deadlock avoidance for model V VM-out-of-N PM algorithm using Two - Way search method has created the problem of taking higher time complexity of O(m*(n - 1)/2 + 2e) where e is the number of edges, for m processes at n sites. This paper proposes the algorithms for allocating multiple resources to competing services running in virtual machines on a heterogeneous distributed platform. We have implemented and performed our algorithm proposed by using CloudSim simulator. The experiments results show that our algorithm can quickly avoid deadlock and then resolve the situation of approximately orders of magnitude in practical cases.

AB The Mobility prediction is one of the important issues in mobile computing systems. The moving logs of mobile users in mobile computing environment are stored in the Home Location Registry (HLR). The generated moving logs are used for mining mobility patterns. The discovered location patterns can be used to provide various location based services to the mobile user by the application server in mobile computing environment. Currently, some papers have written about mobility data mining methods of mobile users in cellular communications networks. In this paper, we propose a method which decrease time to compute the mobility patterns.

AB The paper introduce a Parellel Min-Max Ant System (PMMAS) algorithm using MPI to allocate dynamic resources to multiple service layers while maximizing the utility of the provider in the service-oriented networks. We focus on the pricing model that provide services with different QoS requirements represented by a probabilistic delay bound constraint operate. The objective we aim to be allocate resources responsive to the change in QoS parameters required by each service class using the utility function. The performance of PMMAS algorithm as assessed through numerical experiments to search the approximate optimal solution. Experimental results prove that PMMAS algorithm is more appropriate and effective for the problem than the known approaches.

AB Face clustering is a task to partition facial images into disjoint clusters. In this paper, we investigate a specific problem of face clustering in videos. Unlike traditional face clustering problem with a given collection of images from multiple sources, our task deals with set of face tracks with information about frame ID. Thus, we can exploit two kinds of prior knowledge about the temporal and spatial information from face tracks: sequence of faces in the same track and contemporary faces in the same frame. We utilize this forehand lore and characteristic of low rank representation to introduce a new light weight but effective method entitled Very Fast Sparse Clustering (VFSC). Since the superior speed of VFSC, the method can be adapted into large scale real-time applications. Experimental results with two public datasets (BF0502 and Notting-Hill), on which our proposed method significantly breaks the limits of not only speed but also accuracy clustering of state-of-the-art algorithms (up to 250 times faster and 10% higher in accuracy), reveal the imminent power of our approach.

AB The authors are developing a talking robot which is a mechanical vocalization system modeling the human articulatory system. The talking robot is constructed with mechanical parts that are made by referring to human vocal organs biologically and functionally. In this study, a newly redesign artificial vocal cord is developed for the purpose of extending the speaking capability of the talking robot. The artificial vocal cord is developed using functional approach. A thin layer of rubber band with a width of 7mm is attached on a plastic body in a sealed chamber creates an artificial sound source. The fundamental frequency of the sound source vary from 80Hz to 280 Hz depending on the pressure to the rubber band and the curving shape of the rubber band. The curving shape of the rubber band is adjustable by an innovative design mechanism driven by a servo motor. The amount of air pressure applied to the rubber band is controlled by another servo motor which is referred as volume motor in this study. The experiment to verify the speak capability of the talking robot with this newly redesigned vocal cord is conducted by letting the robot generating five vowel sounds with difference combination of 20 levels of rubber band shape and 10 levels of air pressure input. The pitch and volume of each sound is extracted to determine the effect of the rubber band shape and the pressure input on the output sound. The result shows that this newly redesigned vocal cord greatly increase the speaking capability of the talking robot, especially its singing performance.

AB Vietnam has declared its first official support mechanisms for the development of solar power projects by the Decision 11/2017/QD-TTg, officially signed by the Prime Minister of Vietnam in April 2017. The Decision creates a legal framework for solar energy market and promotes solar electricity development in Vietnam. Since 2016, Energy Department of the University of Science and Technology of Hanoi has been implementing a 15 kWp grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system in Hanoi. The PV array performance is mostly influenced by its tilt angle, orientation, climatic conditions and geographic location. From simulated results, this paper aims to evaluate the performance comparison between a PV automatic tracking system and a PV fixed mounting system on identical PV arrays with the same rated powers in a one-year period, under similar environmental conditions and installed location. Firstly, the architectural design of the entire system is going to be described. Next, the energy outputs of the fixed and tracking system are analyzed by using the PVsyst software as a simulation tool [1]. This work examines the maximum performance of the PV output during the early stage of the system design by adjusting the optimum titled angle of the PV modules monthly, seasonal and yearly for non-tracking PV arrays. Then, the results are compared with the performance of automatic tracking systems. The study confirmed that the automatic single North-South axis tracker, which continuously tracks the sun from East to West, is the most suitable for PV system at Hoa Lac Hi-tech Park in the north of Vietnam, in the tropical zone.

AB In order to improve stability and power quality of the system, there is an essential role in the rapid detection of grid malfunction, particularly in grids with difficult geographical conditions. This article introduces a method which could quickly delineate short-circuit fault location by establishing the corresponding matrix between nodes on grid and short circuit current value. A 50-nodes local medium-voltage network is calculated. The modeling results will be compared to the value of measurement.

DE Resistive Fault Current Limiter (R-FCL); fault current of court circuit;
   110 kv substation; modelisation & simulation
AB In the context of development quickly in recent period, electric power system in Viet Nam, with the power system load increases fastly, this resulted in the phenomenon of increased short circuit current value (NM) on grid. The fast development of the power source in recent period and the increasing power system load have led to rapid rising of short circuit current value on the grid. It existed already many points on the grid where short circuit current values exceed the allowed value. [1]. This article aims at searching, giving out the solutions for limiting the short circuit current on Viet Nam grid by installing a Resistive Fault Current Limiter (R-FCL) into neutral conductor of the transformer. This solution is carried out with the following steps: (1) establishing calculating method for installed resistant value, (2) Simulating grid involved resistive current fault limiter, (3) installing limiter apparatus on the real grid with the Resistant product provided by Bolid manufacturer[2], (4) Comparing the experimental result with the simulating results with the simulating results. This would give out the solution for limiting short circuit current applied in a case on Viet Nam grid-110 Kv Binh An transformer substation. The results have shown high effectiveness of applying R-FCL on Viet Nam grid.

ID QUESTIONS
AB In the context of the Competition on Legal Information Extraction/Entailment (COLIEE), we propose a method comprising the necessary steps for finding relevant documents to a legal question and deciding on textual entailment evidence to provide a correct answer. The proposed method is based on the combination of several lexical and morphological characteristics, to build a language model and a set of features for Machine Learning algorithms. We provide a detailed study on the proposed method performance and failure cases, indicating that it is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches on Legal Information Retrieval and Question Answering, while not needing extensive training data nor depending on expert produced knowledge. The proposed method achieved significant results in the competition, indicating a substantial level of adequacy for the tasks addressed.

ID ENVIRONMENT
AB A general approach is proposed to determine the occupancy in a room using sensor data and knowledge coming respectively from observation and questioning are determined. Means to estimate occupancy include motion detections, power consumptions and acoustic pressure rewarded by a microphone. The proposed approach is inspired from machine learning. It starts by determining the most useful measurements in calculating information gains. Then, a non supervised estimation algorithm is proposed: it relies on Hidden Markov Model and Bayesian Network algorithms to model a human behaviour with probabilistic cause-effect relations and states based on knowledge and questioning. Bayesian Network(BN) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based approaches have been applied to an office setting, with an average estimation error of 0.1-0.08 and an accuracy of 89%-91%. This approach avoids the usage of a camera to determine the actual occupancy required for supervised learning.

AB This paper presents the closed loop teleoperation of a minimal surgery training system using haptic and robot devices. The force tracking performances of system can be improved by using dynamic compensation and fuzzy control. In this system, the master is the 6-DOF haptic device and the slave is the 6-DOF serial robot. The master haptic device provides the trajectories for the slave serial robot throught the operation of user's hand on the steering handle while the slave robot sends feedback forces on its end effector to the master controller in order to generate forces/moments on the steering handle of haptic master. In this manner the user's hand will feel the forces/moments as the same those of the robot end effector. Because dynamics of the master haptic device affects directly to the performances of control actions, it should be calculated to compensate in the control algorithms. Inverse dynamics combined with fuzzy control is used to compensate for actual dynamics of the haptic master in the real closed loop teleoperation system. Experiment results indicate that the dynamic compensation and fuzzy control can improve the control performances effectively.

AB This paper presents Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) compared to Cascade PID control in order to evaluate their performances. The cascade control has an outer loop for the level control and an inner loop for flow control that can make the response faster. There the linearization technique is applied to obtain a new linear model. MRAC is designed based on Lyapunov theory and Barbalet's lemma that will make the system stable and obtain convergences. The reference model can be selected as the third order system with relative degree two to satisfy rise time, settling time, peak time, and overshoot requirements. General adaptive control laws are developed for tuning three gains based on the reference model. These control gains cover level tracking performance. MRAC also help to remove dynamic uncertainties and modeling errors. Simulation results on Matlab/Simulink indicate that the MRAC can improve the control performances compared to those of the classical PID control effectively.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel pre-processing method for the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation of multiple sources in multipath environments. In such environments, radio signals impinging on an antenna array can be either uncorrelated, partially correlated or fully correlated (or coherent signals). The proposed pre-processing technique consists of receiving the radio signals at different time instants while moving the uniform circular array (UCA) in predefined paths. The signal covariance matrix is rendered full rank by averaging the sample covariance matrix estimated from the radio signals impinging on the moving UCA. As a result, conventional super-resolution algorithms such as MUSIC can be applied. The simulation results have shown the superiority of the proposed method in comparison with classical pre-processing techniques.

AB The optical microscope remains a widely-used tool for diagnosis and quantitation of malaria. An automated system that can match the performance of well-trained technicians is motivated by a shortage of trained microscopists. We have developed a computer vision system that leverages deep learning to identify malaria parasites in micrographs of standard, field-prepared thick blood films. The prototype application diagnoses P. falciparum with sufficient accuracy to achieve competency level 1 in the World Health Organization external competency assessment, and quantitates with sufficient accuracy for use in drug resistance studies. A suite of new computer vision techniques-global white balance, adaptive nonlinear grayscale, and a novel augmentation scheme-underpin the system's state-of-the-art performance. We outline a rich, global training set; describe the algorithm in detail; argue for patient-level performance metrics for the evaluation of automated diagnosis methods; and provide results for P. falciparum.

AB Dynamic job shop scheduling (DJSS) problems are combinatorial optimisation problems that have been extensively studied in the literature due to their difficulty and their applicability to real-world manufacturing systems, e. g., car manufacturing systems. In a DJSS problem instance, jobs arrive on the shop floor to be processed on specific sequences of machines on the shop floor and unforeseen events such as dynamic job arrivals and machine breakdown occur that affect the properties of the shop floor. Many researchers have proposed genetic programming based hyper-heuristic (GP-HH) approaches to evolve high quality dispatching rules for DJSS problems with dynamic job arrivals, outperforming good man-made rules for the problems. However, no GP-HH approaches have been proposed for DJSS problems with dynamic job arrivals and machine breakdowns, and it is not known how well GP generalises over both DJSS problem instances with no machine breakdown to problem instances with machine breakdown. Therefore, this paper investigates the generality of GP for DJSS problem with dynamic job arrivals and machine breakdowns. To do this, a machine breakdown specific DJSS dataset is proposed, and an analysis procedure is used to observe the differences in the structures of the GP rules when evolved under different machine breakdown scenarios. The results show that performance and the distributions of the terminals for the evolved rules is sensitive to the frequency of machine breakdowns in the training instances used to evolve the rules.

ID ACTIVITY RECOGNITION
AB In this paper, we proposed an efficient method with flexible framework for vehicle status awareness using smartphone sensors, so called Mobile Online Vehicle Status Awareness System (MOVSAS). The system deployed while users to put their smartphones in any position and at any direction. In our proposed framework, principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm is used to selected suitable features from set of combining features on time-base, power-based and frequency-based domain, which extracted from accelerometer sensor data. The classification model using Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to deploy for awareness issues of vehicle status. The refining model is proposed using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm aim to improved accuracy prediction vehicle status results before. Training data sets, which are collected and the dynamic feedback also helping improved accuracy of system. A number of experiments are shown that the high accuracy of MOVSAS with vehicle kinds as bicycle, motorbike and car.

AB Leaking personal information on mobile devices is a serious problem. Work on information leak detection for mobile devices, until now, mostly focus on action within a single application, while the coordinated action of several applications for the malicious purpose is becoming popular. This study proposes a hybrid approach that combines static and dynamic analysis to detect information leak as a result of the coordinated action of multiple applications. In this text, we call it inter-application malware. The analysis takes place in two stages. In the first stage, we use static analysis to determine the chains of sensitive actions on multiple applications. The chain of sensitive actions is the sequential user's actions that may lead to information leakage. In the second stage, we validate whether the chain of sensitive actions indeed leaks user's data by using the dynamic analysis. In fact, the applications in question are forced to execute after the chains of sensitive actions detected in the first stage. We monitor the sensitive actions to determine which actions make information leak. In order to do so, we modify the Android Emulator to trigger and monitor any action of any applications running on it. We have evaluated our tool, namely eDSDroid, on the famous Toyapps test case. The test result shows the correctness and effectiveness of our tool.

DE Android security; Hybrid analysis; Inter-application communication;
   Sensitive data leakage detection
AB Mobile malwares (especially spyware) target heavily Android operating system. Data is leaked if it exists a sensitive data flow (Data propagation from sensitive source to critical sink). Usually, a sensitive data flow is executed by a chain of actions. In most cases, sensitive data flows are begun and finished in the same application. However, there exist cases where these flows can pass to multi-applications by using inter-application communication. Standalone application analysis can not detect such data flows. Static analysis faces limitations when malware code is obfuscated. Besides, certain actions only take place when receiving input from user. It means that the information related to sensitive data flows is depended on the input data. Which is not available at analysis time when using static analysis technique. In this study, we propose uitHyDroid system that allows to detect sensitive data leakage via multi-applications by using hybrid analysis. uitHyDroid uses static analysis to collect sensitive data flows in each application. Meanwhile, dynamic analysis is used to capture inter-application communications. In this study, to evaluate our approach, we use the extended of DroidBench dataset and applications downloaded from GooglePlay. The experimental results show that almost of sensitive data leakages in the first dataset are correctly detected. Beside that, the proposed system detects several malwares in real-world applications.

DE B-tree; B plus -tree; Hadoop; Map-Reduce; Big data in Vietnam
AB In Socialist Republic of Vietnam, applying the Big data to process any kind of data is still a challenge, especially in the banking sector. Until now, there is only one bank applied Big data to develop a data warehouse system has focused, consistent, can provide invaluable support to executives make immediate decisions, as well as planning long-term strategies, however, it still not able to solve any specific problem. Nowadays, from the fact large amounts of traditional data are still increasing significantly, if B-tree is considered as the standard data structure that manage and organize this kind of data, B+-tree is the most well-known variation of B-tree that is very suitable for applying bulk loading technique in case of data is available. However, it usually takes a lot of time to construct a B+-tree for a huge volume of data. In this paper, we propose a parallel B+-Tree construction scheme based on a Hadoop framework for Transaction log data. The proposed scheme divides the data into partitions, builds local B+-trees in parallel, and merges them to construct a B+-tree that covers the whole data set. While generating the partitions, it considers the data distribution so that each partitions have nearly equal amounts of data. Therefore the proposed scheme gives an efficient index structure while reducing the construction time.

AB E-learning is the application of IT and Internet in education to make it easier, spacious, and more efficient. Advantages of e-learning are recognized, but its impact on learning achievement and knowledge transferring are not confirmed clearly. Learning is considered the skills of students and knowledge gained through experience in the training process. Learning achievement has been defined as students' knowledge, skills and study habits in a training course and effectiveness of their application to their work. Based on previous research, this study suggested that learning achievement as a dependent variable affected by the capacity factors, such as: Computer Self Efficacy, Ease of Use, Perceived Usefulness, Face to Face Interaction, Email Interaction, and Social Presence. Besides, knowledge transfer is also affected by learning achievement. The study result showed that 3 factors: Easiness & Usefulness, E-mail Interaction, and Social Presence have positive impacts on Learning & Transferring knowledge through the elearning system of Bach Khoa University (BKU). Based on analysis results, some managerial implications are suggested for improving the effectiveness of e-learning system at BKU.

AB The ability of a denoising procedure to preserve fine image structures when suppressing unwanted noise has crucial importance for an accurate and effective medical diagnosis. We introduce here a new procedure of edge-preserving denoising for medical images, that combines the flexibility in prior assumptions, and computational effectiveness of parametric multi-quadratic dynamic programming with the increased accuracy of a tree-like representation of a discrete lattice based on the full set of possible adjacency graphs of image elements. Proposed procedure can effectively remove an additive white Gaussian noise with high quality. We provide experimental results in image denoising as well as comparison with related methods.

AB Recently, improvements of latent semantic analysis or LSA which stems from singular value decomposition to derive latent semantic classes, especially hk-LSA model, have been proposed. The hk-LSA model is based on reducing dimension of vector space and like-probabilistic relationship between document-term and latent-topic space. This improved model overcomes some shortcomings of standard LSA such as processing very dense and orthogonal matrices and difficulties in parallelization. It is dealt with this paper, some feasible ways to setup such a model and statistical comparisons between proposed ways to recognize good setup feasible for the hk-LSA model. Case studies on this subject suggest some ways to setup hk-LSA and show relationships between the standard LSA and hk-LSA model.

AB This paper deals with models and tools allowing designers of geographic web application to focus on the design work rather than on the related coding problems. The contributions of this paper are a specific design model and its associated design environement. The proposed design model is composed of elements that can be translated, through transformation model technics, into executable source code taking into account high-level specifications of the designers. This automated code generation property offers a design approach based on short cycles where designers may adjust their specifications until the generated application matches their requirements. To facilitate this process, the proposed model has been integrated into a graphical web-based environment allowing designers to visually express their specifications and then to generate and to execute the specified application.

AB Monitoring events in communication and computing systems becomes more and more challenging due to the increasing complexity and diversity of these systems. Several supporting tools have been created to assist system administrators in monitoring an enormous number of events daily. The main function of these tools is to filter as many as possible events and present highly suspected events to the administrators for fault analysis, detection and report. While these suspected events appear regularly on large and complex systems, such as cloud computing systems, analyzing them consumes much time and effort. In this study, we propose an approach for evaluating the severity level of events using a classification decision tree. The approach exploits existing fault datasets and features, such as bug reports and log events to construct a decision tree that can be used to classify the severity level of other events. The administrators refer to the result of classification to determine proper actions for the suspected events with a high severity level. We have implemented and experimented the approach for various bug report and log event datasets. The experimental results reveal that the accuracy of classifying severity levels by using the decision trees is above 80%, and some detailed analyses are also provided.

AB Kerberos is a distributed authentication protocol which guarantees the mutual authentication between client and server over an insecure network. After the identification, all the subsequent communications are encrypted by session keys to ensure privacy and data integrity. Nowadays, many traditional authentication systems have tried moved to biometric system for convenience. However, the security and privacy of these systems need to put on the table. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient hybrid approach for protecting biometrics in remote authentication protocol based on Kerberos scheme. This protocol is not only resistant against attacks on the insecure network such as man-in-the-middle attack, replay attack,. but also able to protect the biometrics for using fuzzy extractor and non-invertible transformation. These techniques conceal the user's cancelable biometrics into the cryptographic key called biometric key. This key is used to verify a user in authentication phase. Therefore, there is no need to store users' plaint biometrics in the database. Even if biometric key is revealed, it is impossible for an attack to infer the users' biometrics for the high security of the fuzzy extractor scheme. Moreover, another remarkable contribution of this work is that a user can also change his biometric key without replacing his biometrics. The protocol supports multi-factor authentication to enhance security of the entire system.

AB We propose new parallel learning algorithms of local support vector machines (local SVMs) for effectively non-linear classification of large datasets. The algorithms of local SVMs perform the training task of large datasets with two main steps. The first one is to partition the full dataset into k subsets of data, and then the second one is to learn non-linear SVMs from k subsets to locally classify them in parallel way on multi-core computers. The k local SVMs algorithm (kSVM) uses kmeans clustering algorithm to partition the data into k clusters, then constructs in parallel non-linear SVM models to classify data clusters locally. The decision tree with labeling support vector machines (tSVM) uses C4.5 decision tree algorithm to split the full dataset into terminal-nodes, and then it learns in parallel local SVM models for classifying impurity terminal-nodes with mixture of labels. The krSVM algorithm is to train random ensemble of kSVM. The numerical test results on 4 datasets from UCI repository, 3 benchmarks of handwritten letters recognition and a color image collection of one-thousand small objects show that our proposed algorithms of local SVMs (kSVM, tSVM, krSVM) are efficient compared to the standard SVM (LibSVM) in terms of training time and accuracy for dealing with large datasets.

AB Business services arguably play a central role in service-based information systems as they would fill in the gap between the technicality of Service-Oriented Architecture and the business aspects captured in Enterprise Architecture. Business services have distinctive features that are not typically observed in Web services, e.g. significant portions of the functionality of business services might be executed in a human-mediated fashion. The representation of business services requires that we view human activity and human-mediated functionality through the lens of computing and systems engineering. Contractually specifying a business service is crucial for the design and operationalization of business services from the service providers' point of view. In this article, we present an overarching modeling and formalization approach to the contractual specifications of business services. First, business services are conceptually described from three different perspectives, giving rise to a list of service descriptors that matter most for the contractual specifications of services. Second, we formalize the service descriptors. Third, we devise a formal machinery to (a) verify if a group of services contractually match the specification of the bulkier service in question; (b) to assess the contractual proximity of service groups relative to a contractual service specification to help decide which combination of services from acatalog best realize the desired functionality.

AB Energy efficiency has become an important measurement of scheduling algorithms for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds. This paper investigates the energy-efficient virtual machine scheduling problems in IaaS clouds where users request multiple resources in fixed intervals and non-preemption for processing their virtual machines (VMs) and physical machines have bounded capacity resources. Many previous works are based on migration techniques to move on-line VMs from low utilization hosts and turn these hosts off to reduce energy consumption. However, the techniques for migration of VMs could not use in our case. The scheduling problem is NP-hard. Instead of minimizing the number used physical machines, we propose a scheduling algorithm EMinTRELDTF to minimize the sum of total busy time of all physical machines that is equivalent to minimize total energy consumption. In this paper, we present the proved approximation in general and special cases of the scheduling problem. Using Feitelson's and Lublin99' s parallel workload models in the Parallel Workloads Archive, our simulation results show that algorithm EMinTRE-LDTF could reduce the total energy consumption compared with state-of-the-art algorithms including Tian's Modified First-Fit Decreasing Earliest, Beloglazov's Power-Aware Best-Fit Decreasing and Vector Bin-Packing Norm-based Greedy. Moreover, the EMinTRE-LDTF has less total energy consumption compared with our previous heuristic (e.g. MinDFT) in the simulations.

DE Barrier coverage; Coverage graph; Heuristic; Sensor deployment; Wireless
   sensor networks (WSNs)
AB Barrier coverage is one of the most important issues in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and it has been a popular area of WSN research in recent years. Maximizing the number of barrier paths is one of the key factors in the design of barrier coverage algorithms for WSNs. This study proposes a novel concept to optimize the number of barrier paths by minimizing the total moving distance and the number of moving sensor nodes or sensors using two algorithms. After an initial random placement of the sensors, the first approach applies a heuristic method to move all sensors close to the optimal location to maximize the total number of barrier paths. The second approach is used to determine the barrier paths based on a coverage graph and then fill up the barrier gaps by moving the other sensors that do not belong to any available barrier path. The simulation results show that our two proposed algorithms exhibit improved barrier coverage. The results also demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms when compared with other competitive approaches, such as CBarrier and BCLD. The first approach is more suitable for a high degree of fault-tolerant coverage, while the second approach can achieve the optimal number of moving sensors and total moving distance.

TI QoS prediction for web services based on user-trust propagation model
SO NEW REVIEW OF HYPERMEDIA AND MULTIMEDIA
LA English
DT Article
DE Matrix factorisation; social networks; trust propagation; web service
AB There is an important online role for Web service providers and users; however, the rapidly growing number of service providers and users, it can create some similar functions among web services. This is an exciting area for research, and researchers seek to to propose solutions for the best service to users. Collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms are widely used in recommendation systems, although these are less effective for cold-start users. Recently, some recommender systems have been developed based on social network models, and the results show that social network models have better performance in terms of CF, especially for cold-start users. However, most social network-based recommendations do not consider the user's mood. This is a hidden source of information, and is very useful in improving prediction efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a new model called User-Trust Propagation (UTP). The model uses a combination of trust and the mood of users to predict the QoS value and matrix factorisation (MF), which is used to train the model. The experimental results show that the proposed model gives better accuracy than other models, especially for the cold-start problem.

AB This is the first of two papers in which we determine all 242 Wilf classes of triples of 4-letter permutation patterns by showing that there are 32 non-singleton Wilf classes. There are 317 symmetry classes of triples of 4-letter patterns and after computer calculation of initial terms, the problem reduces to showing that counting sequences that appear to be the same (i.e., agree in the first 16 terms) are in fact identical. This amounts to counting avoiders for 107 representative triples. The insertion encoding algorithm (INSENC) applies to many of them and some others have been previously counted. Thus there remain 36 triples. In this paper, we find the generating function for the first 18 of these triples and in a second paper, we treat the other 18. The generating function turns out to be algebraic in each case. Our methods are both combinatorial and analytic, including decompositions by left-right maxima and by initial letters. Sometimes this leads to an algebraic equation for the generating function, sometimes to a functional equation or a multi-index recurrence that succumbs to the kernel method. A bijection is used in one of the cases (Case 50).

AB Visual analytics plays a key role in bringing insights to audiences who are interested and dedicated in data exploration. In the area of relational data, many advanced visualization tools and frameworks are proposed in order to dealing with such data features. However, the majority of those have not greatly considered the whole process from data-model mining to query utilizing on dimensions and data values, which might cause interruption to exploration activities. This paper presents a new interactive exploration framework for relational data analysis through automatic interconnection of data models, data dimensions and data values. The basic idea is to construct a relative and switchable chain of those context representations by integrating our previous techniques on node-link, parallel coordinate and scatterplot graphics. This approach enables users to flexibly make relative queries on desired contexts at any stage of exploration for deep data understanding. The result from a typical case study for the framework demonstration indicates that our approach is able to handle the addressed challenge.

AB In this paper, we consider the online three-dimensional container loading problem. We develop a novel online packing algorithm to solve the three-dimensional bin packing problem in the online case where items are not known well in advance and they have to be packed in real-time when they arrive. This is relevant in many real-world scenarios such as automated cargo loading in warehouses. This is also relevant in the new logistics model of Physical Internet. The effectiveness of the online packing heuristic is evaluated on a set of generated data. The experimental results show that the algorithm could solve the 3D container loading problems in online fashion and is competitive against other algorithms both in the terms of running time, space utilization and the number of bins.

However, the high-dimensional pure Terms-Documents matrix needs transforming to a lower-dimensional semantic Concepts-Documents matrix in order to not only reduce the feature space dimension but also create more meaningful features. This paper analyzes two feature transformation (FT) models on the Terms-Documents matrix, i.e. the FT model based on Low-Rank Approximation (LRA) and the FT model based on Word Embedding (WE). Both of them have their unique strength and weakness in the text transformation. The LRA-based FT only focuses on the mathematical perspective to statistically cover the original dispersed term set of the corpus as well as possible, while the WE-based FT utilizes the available word embedding vectors to enhance the contextual content of the corpus presentation. Therefore, the combinations of the LRA-based FT and the WE-based FT, named LRAintoWE-based FT and WEintoLRA-based FT, are possibly proposed to obtain comprehensive FTs capturing appropriately both the statistical information and the contextual information. The experiment results on three benchmark datasets show that the information of the WE-based FT and the LRA-based FT can be integrated, and their integration as LRAintoWE-based FT and WEintoLRA-based FT can improve the classification performance compared with that based on only either of them.

AB Urban growth has been widely studied and many models (in particular Cellular Automata and Agent-Based Models) have been developed. Most of these models rely on two representations of the geographic space: raster and vector. Both representations have their own strengths and drawbacks. The raster models are simpler to implement and require less data, which explains their success and why most of urban growth models are based on this representation. However, they are not adapted to microscopic dynamics such as, for example, the construction of buildings. To reach such goal, a vector-based representation of space is mandatory. However, very few vector models exist, and none of them is easily adaptable to different case studies. In this paper, we propose to use a simple raster model and to adapt it to a vector representation of the geographic space and processes allowing studying urban growth at fine scale. Both models have been validated by a case study concerning the city of Can Tho, Vietnam.

AB In this paper, we propose two approaches to deal with the problems of video searching: ad-hoc video search and known item search. First, we propose to combine multiple semantic concepts extracted from multiple networks trained on many data domains. Second, to help user find exactly video shot that has been shown before, we propose a sketch based search system which detects and indexes many objects proposed by an object proposal algorithm. By this way, we not only leverage the concepts but also the spatial relations between them.

AB In a wireless multimedia sensor network (WMSN), the minimization of network energy consumption is a crucial task not just for scalar data but also for multimedia. In this network, a camera node (CN) captures images and transmits them to a base station (BS). Several sensor nodes (SNs) are also placed throughout the network to facilitate the proper functioning of the network. Transmitting an image requires a large amount of energy due to the image size and distance; however, SNs are resource constrained. Image compression is used to scale down image size; however, it is accompanied by a computational complexity trade-off. Moreover, direct image transmission to a BS requires more energy. Thus, in this paper, we present a distributed image compression architecture over WMSN for prolonging the overall network lifetime (at high throughput). Our scheme consists of three subtasks: determining the optimal camera radius for prolonging the CN lifetime, distributing image compression tasks among the potential SNs to balance the energy, and, finally, adopting a multihop hierarchical routing scheme to reduce the long-distance transmission energy. Simulation results showthat our scheme can prolong the overall network lifetime and achieve high throughput, in comparison with a traditional routing scheme and its state-of-the-art variants.

AB With the increase of computing power and the development of user-friendly multi-agent simulation frameworks, social simulations have become increasingly realistic. However, most agent architectures in these simulations use simple reactive models. Cognitive architectures face two main obstacles: their complexity for the field-expert modeler, and their computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new cognitive agent architecture based on the Belief-Desire-Intention paradigm integrated into the GAMA modeling platform. Based on the GAML modeling language, this architecture was designed to be simple-to-use for modelers, flexible enough to manage complex behaviors, and with low computational cost. This architecture is illustrated with a simulation of the evolution of land-use in the Mekong Delta.

AB On-line understanding human activities can contribute solutions to some problems existing in the smart-city schema such as health-care, urban mobility, or security. Wearable sensors, especially sensors embedded in smartphones, turn to be good data streams for human activity recognition (HAR) tasks. Unfortunately, most of the existing methods are evaluated on small and fixed-size datasets, and lack of data sharing as well as classifiers re-training functions. These issues will lead to the challenge of unadaptable learning when facing problems of volume and variety of data. In order to tackle these problems, this paper proposes a new method with adaptive, interactive, and general-personal-model training components, and data sharing on the cloud. The major advantage of the proposed method is very fast to detect human activities of a new user at the beginning (i.e. deploying a system to a new user) with an acceptable accuracy of detection using the general model. Then, the personal model will help increase the accuracy of activities detection personally by interacting with users. Another advantage of the proposed method is share data (e.g. sensory data, models, activities, and user's profiles) among users/apps joined the system. These data will help to increase the accuracy of models timely by re-training periodically. Besides, the method can be used as a human-activity sensor that streams detected human activities to related components of smart-city scheme. The proposed method is evaluated and compared to de-facto datasets as well as state-of-the-art of HAR using smartphones. The experimental results show that there is a significant improvement of HAR's accuracy when utilizing the proposed method. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are strongly useful to monitor physical and environmental conditions to provide real-time information for improving environment quality. However, deploying a WSN in a physical environment faces several critical challenges such as high energy consumption, and data loss.
   In this work, we have proposed a reliable and efficient environmental monitoring system in ponds using wireless sensor network and cellular communication technologies. We have designed a hardware and software ecosystem that can limit the data loss yet save the energy consumption of nodes. A lightweight protocol acknowledges data transmission among the nodes. Data are transmitted to the cloud using a cellular protocol to reduce power consumption. Information in the cloud is mining so that real-time warning notifications can be sent to users. If the values are reaching the threshold, the server will send an alarm signal to the pond's owner phone, enable him to take corrective actions in a timely manner. Besides, the client application system also provides the feature to help the user to manage the trend of a physical environment such as shrimp ponds by viewing charts of the collected data by hours, days, months. We have deployed our system using IEEE 802.15.4 Standard, ZigBEE, KIT CC2530 of Texas Instrument, and tested our system with temperature and pH level sensors. Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed system have a low rate of data loss and long energy life with low cost while it can provide real-time data for water quality monitoring.

AB Avoid making bad smells is very important in writing exception handling code for dealing with unexpected runtime errors. The task however is challenging and demands proficient programming skills and experience. This is particularly true in developing JavaScript applications because JavaScript is very rich in features as being dynamic, interpreted and object-oriented with first-class functions. What further complicates the situation is the use of event-driven and non-blocking I/O model in Node.js, which is a runtime environment written in serverside JavaScript.
   Extended from our previous work on exception handling code smells in Java, this study aims at identifying exception handling code smells that can occur in a JavaScript application at either the client side or the server side. The impact to software quality that each smell has is demonstrated with examples. Refactorings corresponding to the identified smells are proposed; their effects to the application, including the robustness level achieved and other benefits gained, are illustrated. The work is intended to serve as a guide in helping JavaScript developers avoid or discover exception handling code smells.

AB Re-engineering is essential for maintaining the competitiveness of enterprises. Enterprise re-engineering involves addressing (emergent) changes, re-organizing, outsourcing, realigning, etc. In this paper, we investigate how to re-engineer enterprises by coupling high-level requirements and the data warehouse, leading to a process re-design that makes the business layer of an enterprise more effective. More specifically, we propose an approach to reasoning about enterprise's strategy together with data mining rules extracted from the data warehouse of the enterprise in order to make design-time changes to its business processes, primarily by means of eliminating redundant tasks and re-ordering inefficiently-located tasks. As such, the redesign is enabled by high-level strategic elements and driven by the enterprise data warehouse. The rationale behind this realignment is to combine yesterday's behavioral facts (i.e., mining enterprise's operational data) with today's operationalization possibilities (e.g., goals), which results in tomorrow's business model. We report our work on the enterprise architecture developed for a retailer of low-cost domestic airfare.

AB Falls are one of the very serious problems in the healthcare system for the elderly, often resulting in a rapid decline in functionality and death. Serious consequences of sustaining a fall include broken or fractured bones, superficial cuts and abrasions as well as soft tissue damage. Several solutions are proposed to resolve such problems, however, major difficulties they encounter are cost, comfort and performance. In this paper, we propose a new Android application for fall detection based on theory of machine learning and data mining. Concretely, we used a classification method to detect if it is a fall down or another common events (e.g. sitting, jumping, etc.). The obtained experimental results show that our proposal yielded impressive results compared to related works.

AB Many studies have shown the associations of microRNAs on human diseases. A number of computational methods have been proposed to predict such associations by ranking candidate microRNAs ac-cording to their relevance to a disease. Among them, network-based methods are usually based on microRNA functional similarity networks which are constructed based on microRNA-target interactions. Therefore, the prediction performances of these methods are highly dependent on the quality of such interactions which are usually predicted by computational methods. Meanwhile, machine learning-based methods usually formulate the disease miRNA prediction as a classification problem, where novel associations between disease and miRNA are predicted based on known disease-miRNA associations. However, those methods are mainly based on single binary classifiers; therefore, they have a limitation in prediction performance. In this study, we proposed a new method, namely RFMDA, to predict disease-associated miRNAs. Our method based on Random Forest (RF), an ensemble technique, where the final classifier is constructed by multitude of decision trees, to perform the prediction. In order to compare with other previous methods, we use the same procedure to build training samples, where positive training samples are known disease-miRNA associations. In addition, features of each sample measure either functional or phenotypical similarities between miRNAs or phenotypes, respectively. Simulation results showed that RFMDA outperformed previous learning-based methods including two binary classifiers (i.e., Naive Bayes and two-class Support Vector Machines) and one semi-supervised classifier (i.e., Regularized Least Square). Moreover, using the trained model, we can predict novel miRNAs associated to some diseases such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB Dependencies in degree k between attributes have an important role in data mining. To quickly discover these dependencies, speeding up calculation of the dependency degree k is needed. This paper will give some presentations of the dependency degree k. Especially, a new concept of D-stripped quotient set is proposed and by using this concept to presentation of the dependency degree k, the computation time of k will decrease significantly. Also based on the concept of D-stripped quotient set, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for a reduction set of attributes.

AB Sequential pattern mining is an active research area because of its diverse applications. There have been many studies suggesting efficient mining algorithms. However, when the size of the dataset is large, these algorithms have limitations, such as performance and scalability. Therefore, parallel mining on a cluster of computers is a necessary issue to study for the sequential pattern mining problem, as the size of the datasets is increasing. In this paper, we propose a parallel algorithm to deal this problem, called DSPDBV, using dynamic vector bit structures on the MapReduce distributed programming model. In addition, the algorithm uses different techniques to prune redundant candidates early and reduce the amount of memory usage. Experimental results show that DSPDBV is highly efficient and scalable for large sequence datasets.

AB Convolutional neural network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) have shown the state of the art results for sentiment analysis in English corpus. However, there are not many studies of this approach for Vietnamese corpus. In our work, CNN and LSTM are employed to generate information channels for Vietnamese sentiment analysis. Because each deep learning model (e.g. CNN, LSTM) has a particular advantage, this scenario provides a novel and efficient way for integrating the advantages of CNN and LSTM. In addition, we introduced a Vietnamese corpus, which collected comments/reviews from Vietnamese commercial web pages and was annotated by three human annotators. We evaluated our approach on our corpus and VLSP corpus. According to the experimental results, the proposed model outperforms SVM, LSTM, and CNN on the two datasets.

AB Legal documents play an important role in the legal systems of every nation. In order to process information automatically and make use of knowledge from legal documents, we need an appropriate knowledge representation for them. In this research, we investigate properties of the Vietnamese legal document system and propose a representation for the documents and their interrelationships. The main challenges for this task are their unstability, limited validity period and complicated interrelationships. Properties and relationships which we design to represent in our knowlege base are selective in order to make use of information within legal documents. In order to represent our knowlege base, we compare three methods: Semantic Network, Production Rules, Frame Language and make use of their advantages in our representation. Moreover, we implement a service-oriented system providing knowledge querying service for other application systems based on our research result.

   School textbooks
AB Text readability has an important role in text drafting and document selecting. Researches on the readability of the text have been made long ago for English and some common languages. There are few studies in Vietnamese text readability and most of them are performed from more than two decades ago on very small corpora. Most of the studies in text readability have few mentions of the impact of the text length in evaluating the text. This paper presents our works on examining the role of text length in assessing the readability. The experiment results show that the features related to the text length have a huge impact on Vietnamese text readability assessment for textbooks.

ID AIR-POLLUTION; TRANSPORT; HEALTH
AB One of the major problems faced in the urban environment is the efficient public transportation of people and goods. Clients make a call to the company to request a transportation service for people or parcels. A good transport scheduling will bring better profits to companies while satisfying people demands and reducing negative social impact such as traffic jam and pollution. We extend the work in [10] on a people and parcel share-a-ride taxis transportation model and propose algorithms to schedule taxis that exploit prediction on requests in an online scenario.

DE Learning Styles; Educational Data Mining; Artificial Neural Networks
AB In recent years, many education researchers concentrated on learning styles and its implications. They relied that people who have different personality types tend to have different learning styles, which in turn influence to students' performance in each type of subjects. To measure the relationship between learning styles and student performance in a subject or entire course, we conducted an online survey with a participation of students in various courses to analysis and show the effects of different learning styles on students' performance. This test based on the Felder-Soloman questionnaire with 44 test questions divided into four dimensions. We have filtered data to select 316 undergraduate students for the analysis. According questionnaire results, we have applied statistical methods to analyze data and issued some important notes. Besides these, we have built an artificial neutral network to predict academic performance based on students' learning style. We have shown some significant relationships between learning style and performance of the testers, which have implications for the studying of a course.

DE DF-SWin; sliding window; data fusion; WSNs
AB When using multiple sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for monitoring (or measuring) parameters of the target and sending the result to the base station (BS), data redundancy is an inevitable problem. The measured data often contains the same information, and sending redundant data to BS causes the waste of energy of sensor nodes and the risk of congestion. Multi-sensor data fusion in WSNs is a technology of gathering and processing data applied from node to BS. It improves the performance of surveillance systems by allowing the obtained sensed information from multiple sensor nodes aggregated to one unified format data packet to send to BS to make decision. In this paper, we propose a solution namely DF-SWin for sampling sensor node in the cluster to optimize the energy conservation of sensor nodes in clusters and cluster head.

AB Character distribution has been extensively used in literature to build models for the detection of web attacks. This paper explores that character distribution models should be built at attribute level in order to achieve a reasonable accuracy. However, attaching detection models to every single attribute leads to high memory and time complexities, which make attribute-specific models less practical. To remove these barriers, a simple yet effective solution has been proposed. In more details, by exploiting the language function of characters, character distribution can be reduced in size and rearranged in an intentional manner so that both time and memory complexities are reduced significantly. Detection models that use minimized and rearranged character distribution are, therefore, highly efficient and practical, especially suitable to large, high-traffic web applications.

DE word similarity; sematic similarity; WordNet; word embeddings
AB Measuring word similarity is a core issue because it has many applications in natural language processing. Although many studies have been reported and the techniques have been developed for addressing this issue for English, however, the study dealing with the applications, analyses and evaluation word similarity techniques to Vietnamese still has not reported yet. Especially, there is still lack of the benchmark Vietnamese dataset for evaluating these techniques. In this paper, we report three main topics including: firstly, construct a benchmark dataset for evaluation of similar techniques to the Vietnamese language; secondly, experiment with some similarity techniques based on WordNet and word embeddings; and finally, propose an extension for Lesk algorithm in order to improving the efficiency of similar measuring with Vietnamese language.

AB In data mining, anomaly detection aims at identifying the observations which do not conform to an expected behavior. To date, a large number of techniques for anomaly detection have been proposed and developed. Recently, researchers have paid their attention to ensemble methods to improve the accuracy of anomaly detection algorithms. Particularly, Sequential Ensemble Method (SEQ) proposed recently has shown significant improvement over other techniques. The idea of SEQ is to evaluate the scores of samples by using a second algorithm with respect to the first algorithm's output. In other words, an algorithm is firstly used to choose a set of the highest suspect abnormal samples (D-ref) and then a second algorithm is applied to evaluate the final score of each data samples in the dataset with respect to only D-ref. In this paper, we propose an improvement of SEQ by introducing a new way to build D-ref that is based on the highest suspect normal samples instead of abnormal samples. The new algorithm is applied to a number of benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method provided better and more stable performance compared to the previous version of SEQ and six individual algorithms.

AB Object-oriented domain-driven design (DDD) aims to develop software (iteratively) around a realistic model of the application domain, which both thoroughly captures the domain requirements and is technically feasible for implementation. The main focus of existing work in DDD has been on using an annotation-based extension of object-oriented programming language to build the domain model. However, these work do not consider software modules as first-class objects and thus lack a method for their development. In this paper, we propose a generative software module development method to bridge this gap. More specifically, we make the following contributions: (1) An annotation-based internal DSL named MCCL for configuring the modules. This language uses a reflective module configuration class design. (2) A module configuration class generator that generates a module configuration class from a domain class. (3) Update the module configuration class of a module when this module's structure is changed. (4) Demonstrate MCCL using a Java software tool.

AB This paper is meant as the object recognition work done directly on images obtained from the autonomous car's camera. Normally, before the recognition stage, images need to process with the purpose of locating the candidate regions. This paper does not concentrate on the location stage, but focus on contributing a new descriptor for object recognition. Particularly, objects such as traffic-sign are recognized based on the sparse representation of object's descriptor over learned dictionary. The main idea is training the dictionary of local descriptors, or building the basis of a local descriptor space. Then, using the representation of description of object over this basis, we define a object's descriptor. We approve the robustness of the proposed descriptor under the linear transformation such as rotation or scale etc. Moreover, the stage of building the basis of descriptor space is done offline, thus computing time is quite reliably for the autonomous car. The experiments done on a database including traffic-sign images show that the proposed method is promising and competitive related to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB This paper presents an empirical study of two widely-used sequence prediction models, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), on two fundamental tasks for Vietnamese text processing, including part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition. We show that a strong lower bound for labeling accuracy can be obtained by relying only on simple word-based features with minimal handcrafted feature engineering, of 90.65% and 86.03% performance scores on the standard test sets for the two tasks respectively. In particular, we demonstrate empirically the surprising efficiency of word embeddings in both of the two tasks, with both of the two models. We point out that the state-of-the-art LSTMs model does not always outperform significantly the traditional CRFs model, especially on moderate-sized data sets. Finally, we give some suggestions and discussions for efficient use of sequence labeling models in practical applications.

AB Fuzzy relational compositions play a crucial role in fundamentals of fuzzy mathematics as well as in distinct application areas. Recent studies introduce distinct generalizations, e.g., incorporation of excluding features or the use of generalized quantifiers. No matter the huge positive potential of these approaches, we demonstrate on a real example, that some limitations even for these extensions may be encountered if the features are constructed in a certain specific yet very natural way. However, these limitations can be overcome by a further improvement if a sort of grouping of features is applied. In particular, we study the compositions of fuzzy relations based on partitioned universe of features and then the combination of both above mentioned extensions will be applied and experimentally validated. The results are compared to the original ones provided in the investigation of excluding features without any implementation of generalized quantifiers nor with grouping of the features.

DE Consistency model; refactoring; OCL; FOL
AB Refactoring is a technique that transforms a software structure to new one in order to improve the internal structure without affect its external behaviors. Although refactoring has shown a number of advantages, it has not been widely adopted in practice as expected. One of the big challenges to refactoring is the lack of tool support that may be raised some issues such as tedious, time-consuming and error-prone. We present in this paper a tool called CVT (Consistency Validator Tool) that used to assist to checking consistency in model refactoring. The CVT is composed of three essential modules which are well-formedness checking, translate OCL into FOL and behavioral consistency checking. We are most interested in OCL to FOL translation process that make use of Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) as an intermediate syntax. We have also carried out some experimental studies to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool.

AB In the cancer research, a number of stratification methods have been successfully applied and have assisted in the treatment process. Currently, various data types related to the cancer patients have been measured and collected. This fact leads to a great need of data integration for obtaining more comprehensive cancer study. Most of the previous work is based on a single data type and employed a tailor-made method for a specific data type. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient approach, using multiple kernel learning methods, to better stratify cancer patients. We integrated the three most related-cancer data, including gene expression, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression. The model has combined multiple kernel learning methods and dimensionality reduction. The achieved results demonstrated that our integrative model was more accurate than the ones based on single data type. Our work holds a great promise to contribute to theoretical cancer research and effectively support the prevention and prognosis.

AB This paper proposes an approach for integrating social networks into intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), especially for predicting student performance (PSP). Firstly, we review the main concepts of the ITS as well as matrix factorization technique and social matrix factorization in Recommender Systems (RS). Next, this work introduces how to map the ITS data into the context of user, item and rating in the RS, and shows how to convert social networks to relationships matrix. Then, the prediction model, which is integrated social networks, is proposed for building the ITS. Experimental results on two real datasets show that integrating social relationships of students can be able to increase the accuracy of the prediction models.

DE 3D pose reconstruction; 2D pose estimation; single view image/video
AB In this paper, we propose an improved framework for estimating 3D human pose sequences from 2D videos. Prior methods were declared to solve this problem; however, they sometimes produced invalid poses because the constraint of result poses was not robust enough to satisfy anthropometric regular body pose. Our goal is to eliminate this drawback, provide more accurate estimated poses. The proposed framework consists of three stages. First, we start by generating a set of class-independent body part candidates for each video frame and constructing a fully connected graph from these candidates. Integer linear programming is used to label each candidate by a part class and assign it to individuals to form accurate and consistent pose. We then make the outputs from the first stage suitable for the next stage by inferring the 2D joint configuration. Second, from 2D poses resulted from the first stage, 3D poses are reconstructed by a matching pursuit algorithm operating on camera projection, all the output must adapt the anthropometric regular body pose constraint such as limb length and joint angle constraint. Third, we exploit the temporal and spatial information in videos to obtain more accurate 3D poses. Our experiments on CMU MOCAP dataset show that the proposed framework produces better results compared with prior works.

AB In this paper, we investigate Vietnamese food recognition problem and compare different methods by using traditional hand-crafted features and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To this aim, we first introduce one dataset including five popular Vietnamese dishes with more than 2000 images. We then conduct various experiments on that dataset and analyze the performance of each approach. The experiments show that CNNs outperform the hand-crafted techniques by a significant margin.

AB Facial expressions convey non-verbal information between humans in face-to-face interactions. Automatic facial expression recognition, which plays a vital role in human-machine interfaces, has attracted increasing attention from researchers since the early nineties. Classical machine learning approaches often require a complex feature extraction process and produce poor results. In this paper, we apply recent advances in deep learning to propose effective deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that can accurately interpret semantic information available in faces in an automated manner without hand-designing of features descriptors. We also apply different loss functions and training tricks in order to learn CNNs with a strong classification power. The experimental results show that our proposed networks outperform state-of-the-art methods on the well-known FERC-2013 dataset provided on the Kaggle facial expression recognition competition. In comparison to the winning model of this competition, the number of parameters in our proposed networks intensively decreases, that accelerates the overall performance speed and makes the proposed networks well suitable for real-time systems.

AB Facial expression analysis plays a key role in analyzing emotions and human behaviors. Smile detection is a special task in facial expression analysis with various potential applications such as photo selection, user experience analysis, smiling payment and patient monitoring. Conventional approaches often extract low-level face descriptors and detect smile based on a strong binary classifier. In this paper, we propose an effective architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect smile in real-time speed with high accuracy. The experimental results show that our proposed network outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods.

AB Whole exome sequencing (WES) is a widely used technique in both medical studies and clinical practice. However, a number of studies show that the results produced by different WES analysis pipelines are not always homogeneous. To this end, we propose a method (called Genomedics) using a consensus approach to expand the list of variants by combining results called from six separate pipelines with sensitive options. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, Gemomedics was compared to seven existing methods when they were tested on two datasets and F1-score was used as an indicator of accuracy. The results showed that Genomedics has the highest score among seven methods. We also applied Genomedics to analyze whole exomes from Multiple Myeloma and Dravet syndrome patients and found interesting results. The results demonstrate the promising applications of Genomedics in clinical studies.

AB One of the major concerns in knowledge integration is inconsistencies in knowledge bases. An inconsistency measure is a tool that helps analyzing inconsistency knowledge bases and resolving inconsistencies. In recent years, a wide range of measures with desirable properties have been proposed, however, these measures often correspond to logical, or probabilisticlogical framework. In this paper, we investigate several inconsistency measures and their properties for the knowledge bases represented by probabilistic framework.

ID INFORMATION
AB This paper presents a study on analyzing questions in legal domain for Vietnamese language, which is an important step in building an automated question answering system for the domain. We focus on questions about transportation law - the law with arguably the largest number of violations and thus is the most asked about. Given a legal question in natural language, our goal is to extract important information such as Type of Vehicle, Action of Vehicle, Location, and Question Type. We model the question analysis task as a sequence labeling problem and present a CRF-based method to deal with it. Experimental results on a corpus consisting of 1678 Vietnamese questions show that our method can extract 16 types of information with high precision and recall.

AB In this article, we propose a linear threshold model to the problem of minimizing the spread of misinformation for cases where partial knowledge of misinformation sources is available by using monitors, the misinformation propagation time and the budget for placing monitors are restricted, and proved it is NP-Hardness. At the same time, we also suggest two greedy algorithms to solve the problem. Experimental results show the dominant advantages of the algorithms in comparison with other commonly used algorithms.

ID SELECTION
AB Data clustering is one of the most important tasks in machine learning and data mining, which aims to discover structure and the relational between observations inside data sets. In many situations, side information about the clusters is available in addition to the values of the features. For example, the cluster labels of some observations may be known (called seeds), or certain observations may be known to belong (or not) to the same cluster (pairwise constraints). Many semi-supervised clustering algorithms are presented in literature to improve the clustering accuracy by effectively exploring these available side information. However, each algorithm usually uses one kind of side information. In this paper, we propose a new semisupervised density based clustering which integrates both kinds of side information, and embeds an active learning strategy in the process of finding clusters, named MCSSDBS. Experiments conducted on real data sets from UCI show the effectiveness of our algorithm compared with the semi-supervised density-based clustering (SSDBSCAN)

AB Natural language generation (NLG) plays an important role in a Spoken Dialogue System. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based approaches have shown promising in tackling NLG tasks. This paper presents approaches to enhance gating mechanism applied for RNN-based natural language generator, in which an attentive dialog act representation is introduced, and two gating mechanisms are proposed to semantically gate input sequences before RNN computation. The proposed RNN-based generators can be learned from unaligned data by jointly training both sentence planning and surface realization to produce natural language responses. The model was extensively evaluated on four different NLG domains. The results show that the proposed generators achieved better performance on all the NLG domains in comparison to the previous generators.

AB Recognition of human gestures/actions is still a challenging problem due to the complexity of human movement. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has been shown to be a powerful classification tool to achieve state-of-the-art results on various recognition tasks. However, because of the need of organizing the input into a number of feature maps, it is still limited to be applied to skeletal gesture data recorded by motion capture devices. In this paper, we present an effective way to reorganize gesture input composed of skeletal joints into feature maps, which enables us to apply CNNs to recognize skeleton based gestures. In addition, we also present a multi-column architecture that combines multiple results into a single one, offering better recognition performance for skeleton based gesture data. The presented methods are evaluated on the challenging dataset MSRC-12, containing 12 gestures, performed by 30 participants. Experimental results show that our network achieves better performance than SVM and RVM reported in [4].

AB This paper describes a fusion technique for species identification from images of different plant organs. Given a series of image organs such as branch, entire, flower or leaf, we firstly extract confidence scores for each single organ using a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network (CNN). After that, we deploy various schemes of the fusion approaches including not only conventional transformation-based approaches (sum rule, max rule, product rule) but also a classification-based approach (support vector machine). Then we proposed a hybrid fusion model. To measure the performances of the combination schemes, a large number of images of 50 species which are collected from two main resources: PlantCLEF 2015 dataset and the Internet resources. The experiment exhibits the dominant results of the fusion techniques compared with those of individual organs. At rank-1, the highest accuracy of a single organ is 73.0% for flower images, whereas by applying our proposed fusion technique for leaf and flower, the accuracy reaches to 89.8%.

   Image Classification using CNN
AB Image classification is critical and significant research problems in computer vision applications such as facial expression classification, satellite image classification, plant (fruits, flowers, leaf.) classification base on images. This paper proposes the image classification model applied for identifying the display of the online advertisement. The proposal model uses Convolutional Neural Network with two parameters (n, m) where n is a number of layers and m is number of filters in Conv layer. The proposed model is called nLmF-CNN. The suitable values of parameters (n, m) for advertisement image classification are identified by experiments. The input data of the proposed model are online captured images. The processing components of nLmF-CNN are developed as deep neural networks using ConvNetJs library. The output of the proposed model is YES/NO. YES means that the advertisements display clearly. NO means that the advertisements do not display or not clear. The experimental results 86% in our normalizing dataset showed the feasibility of a proposed model nLmF-CNN.

DE Dialog act segmentation; functional segment; Vietnamese conversation
AB Dialog act identification plays an important role in understanding conversations. It has been widely applied in many fields such as dialogue systems, automatic machine translation, automatic speech recognition, and especially useful in systems with human-computer natural language dialogue interfaces such as virtual assistants and chatbots. The first step of identifying dialog act is identifying the boundary of the dialog act in utterances. In this paper, we focus on segmenting the utterance according to the dialog act boundaries, i.e. functional segments identification, for Vietnamese utterances. We investigate carefully functional segment identification in two approaches: (1) machine learning approach using maximum entropy (ME) and conditional random fields (CRFs); (2) deep learning approach using bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with a CRF layer (Bi-LSTM-CRF) on two different conversational datasets: (1) Facebook messages (Message data); (2) transcription from phone conversations (Phone data). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies deep learning based approach to dialog act segmentation. As the results show, deep learning approach performs appreciably better as to compare with traditional machine learning approaches. Moreover, it is also the first study that tackles dialog act and functional segment identification for Vietnamese.

DE rice mapping; Red River Delta; Landsat 8; XGBoost
AB Paddy rice, an important crop in Vietnam, need to be monitored and managed for food security, water resource management and Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. In this study, we present preliminary results of rice mapping in Red River Delta (RRD) region, one of two largest rice planting area in Vietnam. We employ all available Landsat 8 acquired over RRD, regardless of cloud coverage, to establish yearly rice maps from 2013 to 2016. A time-series classification scheme is proposed which includes two main stages. At first, all Landsat 8 images in classification year are used to create monthly composite images. Then, time-series features are extracted to feed an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier which is able to work with sparse features. Validation against test data show promising results with overall accuracy of 89.42 - 91.53%, kappa of 0.76 - 0.79 and F1 score of 0.90 - 0.92. Map validation against statistical data at provincial levels shows high correlations with R2 ranging from 0.96-0.98 and mapped rice areas difference from statistical rice areas is from 7.06% - 15.42%. The results highlighted effect of our approach in which Landsat 8 images are only used but rice maps are still created with fine spatial resolution, high accuracy and large coverage over cloud-prone areas.

   information extraction; text mining
AB Nowadays, users are much more willing to share their daily activities, their thoughts or feelings, and even their intentions (e.g., buy an apartment, rent a car, travel to somewhere, etc.) on online social media channels. Understanding intents of online users, therefore, has become a crucial need in many different business areas like production, finance/banking, real estate, tourism, e-commerce, and online marketing. In this paper, we will present our solutions to extract intent information from online social media texts. This can be seen as an information extraction or sequential segmentation task. In order to perform this task, we have built our machine learning models based on conditional random fields (CRFs), an advanced statistical graphical model for sequence data, and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), a well-known deep learning model. To evaluate our methods, we have defined two intent extraction tasks in two domains: real estate and cosmetic & beauty. For each task, we have defined the tag set as well as prepared the labeled data set that consists of Vietnamese social media text posts with the annotation of intent words/phrases. Experimental results showed that the proposed methods can effectively extract intent information from online texts with significantly high accuracy.

AB In this paper, we build an emotion prediction system by only using heart rate signals. This system can easily support any heart-rate sensor and smartphone to enhance users' experience. We collect heart-rate data from registered users from a heart-rate sensor by building an Android application, namely Emotion and Heart Rate Collection. We analyze different kinds of feature vectors and compare various supervised learning models, including k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and decision tree. The experiments show that using SVM can achieve the highest performance in comparison with other approaches.

AB Although knowledge sharing (KS), the key to creativity and innovation, are increasingly common in organisations, research on the relationship between knowledge sharing behaviour (KSB) and transactive memory system (TMS) and its effect on innovative work behaviour (IWB) is relatively rare. Prior studies have reported that KS influences IWB in organisations. However, the effect of KSB on IWB and the join influence between TMS on KS and IWB have not been adequately investigated in past research. Therefore, the goal of this research-in-progress is to propose a conceptual model comprising three construct domains including KSB, TMS quality and IWB to examine the impact of the KS practices of employees on their IWB in organisations. We advance to conduct a survey to examine our discussion of the proposed conceptual model. It is expected that this research will contribute to the deeper understanding of the effects of KSB and TMS on IBW within organisation. Implications and future research are also proposed.

DE Shunt active power filter; harmonics; Proportional-Integral controller;
   Genetic Algorithm; Switching frequency
AB Shunt active power filter is a powerful electric device used to eliminate harmonic components which are harmful to the electric network and equipment. There are two main parameter groups of the shunt active power filter (SAPF) should be optimized in order to get the better performance, and reduce the switching frequency of the devices of the inverter. The first group is the values of the DC link capacitor and coupling inductor. The second one is the parameters of the ProportionalIntegral controllers for controlling the power losses, and threephase compensating currents. This paper presents the solution using Genetic algorithm to tune the coefficients of the PI controllers and to obtain optimum values of the capacitor and inductor of the filter at the same time. The proposed methodology is demonstrated via Matlab/Simulink environment such that the total harmonic distortion (THD) equals 1.48% while the switching frequency (f(s)) of the Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) bridge is only 50 kilohertz.

AB In maintaining a WebGIS system, the update and creation of thematic maps are time consuming, human resource comsuming and then cost consuming. This paper concentrates on developing TMACT tool for automatically creating thematic maps. There are two main functions of TMACT. The first one is that TMACT automatically creates thematic-map-services from an Excel file which stored geodata collected by end-users. The second one is that TMACT provides APIs to make WebGIS systems work with TMACT to get thematic-map-services and generate thematic maps. TMACT supports an Interactive Web User Interface for normal users and a command line interface for developers. We then demonstrate the application of TMACT to a Intelligent Traffic System (ITS) system. It costs 15 minutes to create a new thematic map for ITS system by a technician. When we applied TMACT to ITS, it costs only two minutes to create a new thematic map without a technician.

AB In this study, MIKE NAM, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and a hybridization of ANNs and Particle Swarm Optimization (ANN-PSO) are utilized to predict the Dak Nong runoff. ANNs are trained by the back-propagation (BP) procedure [1] which is based on the gradient descent algorithm and an incorporating algorithm of PSO and BP [2]. Moreover, to improve the performance of ANNs, a common method of time series analysis, so-called partial autocorrelation function (PACF), is collaboratively used. The experimental results are conducted on a dataset collected in the Dak Nong basin for the duration of 1981-2007. The experiments demonstrate that PACF significantly impacts the performance of ANNs. Although ANN-PSO is not superior to ANNs trained by BP (ANN-BP) in this study, ANN-PSO outperforms ANN-BP in terms of capturing the peaks of the Dak Nong runoff. In addition, both ANN-BP and ANN-PSO outperform MIKE NAM.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Yield assessment is one of the main interests at regional and national levels of agriculture management. The accuracy of the assessment is not highly expected inherently and, moreover, some costly and sophisticated tools (e.g., satellite images) have been usually involved without a careful consideration of their investment. In this paper, a novel approach has been proposed orienting to farmers (especially in Southeastern Asia) who are only affordable for low cost and easy-to-use tools. With this vision, the paper presents an idea to co-operate certain, powerful and modern technologies-deep neural networks (DNNs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-with respect to solving the problem of yield assessment. The imagery of paddy fields acquired by UAVs at low altitudes is then used for training DNNs and assessing the yield of the paddy fields. Four DNN models are applied to figure out the most appropriate one for this approach. To test the applicability of the proposed approach, some experiments are conducted on a dataset which was collected at paddy fields in Tay Ninh province, Vietnam. The yield assessment is not directly predicted from DNNs, instead being achieved by a combination of the classification results and a bush-level yield estimation of agricultural experts in the fields. The paper indicates that the proposed approach is quite potential for precision agriculture, along with some remaining challenges.

ID DISCOVERY
AB The goal of this work is to cluster frequently appearing visual instances from a collection of images, called visual instance mining. State-of-the-art approaches employ clustering on the matching graph. Although these graph-based approaches are quite effective, their performances are still modest. In this paper, we propose two methods to further improve the accuracy of graph-based approaches. Firstly, we improve graph construction by integrating geometric constraints. Particularly, we exploit Hamming Embedding code, burstiness removal, and geometric consistency in our framework to remove false connections. Secondly, unlike most of the existing methods which cluster images similar to an entry point, we cluster them by prioritizing the correlation between the candidates and members in the cluster. We enlarge the cluster by adding the nearest candidate at each re-expanding. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. Especially, our results are 21.2% and 5.5% higher than the latest results, conducted respectively in MQA dataset and PartialDup dataset.

ID POSTURE
AB Many approaches to human activity recognition such as wearable based or computer vision based are obtrusive in the sense that they prevent the users from performing activities in a natural way, or they might raise privacy invasion concerns. This paper presents e-Shoes - smart shoes for unobtrusive human activity recognition. E-Shoes are shoes instrumented with tiny wireless accelerometers embedded inside the insole of the shoes. The sensors are seamless to the users making the system suitable for recognizing everyday activities. To analyze sensor signals, we propose a convolution neutral networks (CNN) model that automatically learns features from sensing data and makes predictions about performing activities. We verify the effectiveness of the approach with a real dataset that covers seven daily activities. The system achieved 93% accuracy in average, which is very promising, while being energy efficient and easy to use.

AB UAV images are important data sources for search and rescue works both on sea and on land. It is a modern, suitable technological solution and in many situations there is no alternative method. Geometrical approach to pattern recognition tasks does not address spectral abnormal signatures in captured scenes. In this study the authors have investigated effectiveness of anomaly detection algorithms on different color spaces transformed from UAV images. The main goal of the research is to discover the most appropriate couples algorithm - color space in different terrain types. The proposal approach have been validated on test datasets and has shown promising results.

AB There have been an increasing number of various machine learning-based models successfully proposed and applied for automatic chemical-induced disease (CID) relation extraction. They, however, usually require carefully handcrafted rich feature sets, which rely on expert knowledge, thus require expensive human labor but normally still cannot generalize data well enough. In this paper, we propose a CID relation extraction model that learns features automatically through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) instead of traditional handcrafted features. We exploit the shortest dependency path between a disease and a chemical for identifying their CID relation. Dependency relations, with and without their direction information, are further investigated. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (namely the BioCreative V dataset) are very potential, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed model for CID relation extraction.

AB A constrained k nearest neighbors (k-NN) query retrieves a set of k nearest objects within a predefined region. Although there are many proposed methods dedicated for continuously monitoring k-NN queries, most of them concerning traditional k-NN queries, only some methods focus on constrained k-NN queries. In this paper, the authors propose MergedGrid, an algorithm to further enhance the performance of GridTree, a novel method for continuously monitoring constrained k-NN queries. Without the need of prior knowledge about the number of objects in the dataset, our algorithm significantly reduces computation time in comparison with the previous algorithm.

AB In this paper, a low computational complexity Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Multiple Input - Multiple Output(OFDM - MIMO) decoder for the 802.11ac Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) is addressed. To reduce the computational complexity of the conventional K-Best algorithm, the combination of two new approaches to determine the K-best nodes are introduced. The first approach is the constellation I-Q plane based sorting method to sort an one-dimension vector in ascending order. The second one is the table based sorting method to sort a two-dimension vector in ascending order. By simulation results, the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of our proposed approaches is only degraded 0.5 dB compared with that of the conventional K-Best algorithm, but our proposal helps to reduce up to 97% of the computational complexity in term of sorting method.

AB High-level enterprise services are considered as wrappers of business processes and ICT capabilities in enterprise architecture. Enterprise services have distinctive features that are not typically observed in Web services, e.g. signicant portions of the functionality of these services might be executed in a human-mediated fashion. As such, a service level agreement should be described as a mixture of human-mediated functionality (e.g., service penalty) and computer-interpretable factors (e.g., reliability, payment). This paper reports our preliminary work in defining a taxonomy for co-relating SLAs with elements of enterprise architecture. It gives insight into the alignment between what the enterprise in questions contractually agrees with its partners (or customers) and what it possesses to be able to fulfill the agreement. We define the service level agreement formally. We adopt the ArchiMate -a widely used language for modeling and analyzing enterprise architectures. We then propose the corelation between items in the agreement with elements in the enterprise architecture. We showcase our work using a real-life case-study in the retailing market of domestic airfare.

AB The phenols are structurally heterogeneous pollutants and they present a variety of modes of toxic action (MOA), including polar narcotics, weak acid respiratory uncouplers, pro-electrophiles, and soft electrophiles. Because it is often difficult to determine correctly the mechanism of action of a compound, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods, which have proved their interest in toxicity prediction, can be used. In this work, several QSAR models for the prediction of MOA of 221 phenols to the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena pyriformis, using Chemistry Development Kit descriptors, are reported. Four machine learning techniques (ML), k-nearest neighbours, support vector machine, classification trees, and artificial neural networks, have been used to develop several models with higher accuracies and predictive capabilities for distinguishing between four MOAs. They showed global accuracy values between 95.9% and 97.7% and area under Receiver Operator Curve values between 0.978 and 0.998; additionally, false alarm rate values were below 8.2% for training set. In order to validate our models, cross-validation (10-folds-out) and external test-set were performed with good behaviour in all cases. These models, obtained with ML techniques, were compared with others previously reported by other researchers, and the improvement was significant.

AB This paper proposes an approach to solve the transient stability constraint optimal power flow (TSC-OPF) problem. The transient stability constraints are expressed as the critical clearing time (CCT) of different contingencies, and are approximated using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The ANNs provide a nonlinear, differentiable mapping between the load flow variables and the CCT. As a result, the TSC-OPF with multiple transient stability constraints can be solved very efficiently with little additional computational burden. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with the IEEE 39 bus and the IEEE 300 bus systems.

AB This paper constructs L-covering fuzzy variable precision rough set and mainly studies some properties of type I and type II L-covering fuzzy lower and upper approximation operators of L-fuzzy sets on X. Topology properties of type I and type II L-covering fuzzy lower and upper approximation operators are also discussed through a fuzzy interior operator and fuzzy closure operator. Moreover, we investigate the dual properties and compare between L-covering fuzzy variable precision rough approximation operators.

AB Neutrosophic set, proposed by Smarandache considers a truth membership function, an indeterminacy membership function and a falsity membership function. Soft set, proposed by Molodtsov is a mathematical framework which has the ability of independency of parameterizations inadequacy, syndrome of fuzzy set, rough set, probability. Those concepts have been utilized successfully to model uncertainty in several areas of application such as control, reasoning, game theory, pattern recognition, and computer vision. Nonetheless, there are many problems in real-world applications containing indeterminate and inconsistent information that cannot be effectively handled by the neutrosophic set and soft set. In this paper, we propose the notation of bipolar neutrosophic soft sets that combines soft sets and bipolar neutrosophic sets. Some algebraic operations of the bipolar neutrosophic set such as the complement, union, intersection are examined. We then propose an aggregation bipolar neutrosophic soft operator of a bipolar neutrosophic soft set and develop a decision making algorithm based on bipolar neutrosophic soft sets. Numerical examples are given to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed approach.

AB Crowdsourcing can be an organisational strategy to distribute work to Internet users and harness innovation, information, capacities, and variety of business endeavours. As crowdsourcing is different from other business strategies, organisations are often unsure as to how to best structure different crowdsourcing activities and integrate them with other organisational business processes. To manage this problem, we design a process model guiding how to establish business process crowdsourcing. The model consists of seven components covering the main activities of crowdsourcing processes, which are drawn from a knowledge base incorporating diverse knowledge sources in the domain. The built model is evaluated using case studies, suggesting the adequateness and utility of the model.

AB Android has become the most popular mobile operating system. Millions of applications, including many malware, haven been developed for it. Even though its overall system architecture and many APIs are documented, many other methods and implementation details are not, not to mention potential bugs and vulnerabilities that may be exploited. Manual documentation may also be easily outdated as Android evolves constantly with changing features and higher complexities. Techniques and tool supports are thus needed to automatically extract information from different versions of Android to facilitate whole-system analysis of undocumented code. This paper presents an approach for alleviating the challenges associated with whole-system analysis. It performs usual program analysis for different versions of Android by control-flow and data-flow analyses. More importantly, it integrates information retrieval and query heuristics to customize the graphs for purposes related to the queries and make whole- system analyses more efficient. In particular, we use the approach to identify functions in Android that can be invoked by applications in either benign or malicious way, which are referred to as publicly accessible functions in this paper, and with the queries we provided, identify functions that may access sensitive system and/or user data and should be protected by certain permission checks. Based on such information, we can detect some publicly accessible functions in the system that may miss sufficient permission checks. As a proof of concept, this paper has analyzed six Android versions and shows basic statistics about the publicly accessible functions in the Android versions, and detects and verifies several system functions that miss permission checks and may have security implications.

ID PROTECTION
AB Network coding (NC) features a new perspective for leveraging network performances as more efficient resources utilization could be achieved. In recent years, the application of NC to the realms of failure recovery in optical networks has been receiving growing attention and indeed, combining the nearinstantaneous recovery of dedicated protection and improved capacity efficiency enabled by NC constitutes an important research trend in optical protection. In order to maximize the bene fits empowered by NC, a critical problem on routing of traffic demands, selecting demands for encoding and determining the respective coding node and coding links has to be optimally addressed. The problem becomes even more challenging if multiple traffic demands are considered at once and the traffic is non-equal. In addressing those issues, for the first time, we present a novel unified framework for augmenting 1 + 1 dedicated protection against single link failures with a practical network coding scheme based on XOR operation for both equal and non-equal traffic scenarios. In line with this framework, a mathematical model in the form of integer linear programming for optimal routing and network coding assignment to minimize the path cost is presented. Numerical results based on evaluating the model on realistic topologies and all-to-one traffic setting highlight the cost advantages of our proposed NC-assisted protection scheme compared to traditional counterparts.

AB The k-means algorithm is a popular clustering algorithm. However, while k-means is convenient to implement, it produces solutions that are locally optimal. It depends on the number of clusters k and initialisation seeds. We introduce a method that can be used directly as a clustering algorithm or as an initialisation of the k-means algorithm based on the cluster number optimisation. The problem is the number of parameters required to find an optimal solution. We propose to apply diversity of population maintained through different evolutionary subpopulations and to apply the elitist strategy to select only the best concurrent solution. We also propose a new mutation strategy according to the neighbourhood search. This cooperative strategy allows us to find the global optimal solution for clustering tasks and optimal cluster seeds. We conduct numerical experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on multi-class datasets, overlapped datasets and large-size datasets.

AB Hybrid analog digital (HDA) architectures have been widely used in communication systems for analog source over discrete-time memoryless Gaussian channels. They employ a linear coding scheme in the analog parts, while considering separately the design of source and channel codes in the digital parts. To the best of our knowledge, none of the previous HDA schemes exploit the advantages of maintaining a joint source and channel coding design in the digital segment. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the analog parts on various outputs of the digital modules in a HDA communication system, and introduce a novel HDA architecture with adaptation for the digital parts. Such adaptation allows our system to exploit the joint effect of the analog components and the channel noise on outputs of the digital components, while simultaneously taking into consideration the unequal distribution of source code outputs. Our simulations illustrate that the proposed HDA system provides robust and graceful performance (on both bandwidth compression and expansion modes) for a wide range of channel conditions.

AB Vietnam is one of the most dynamic retail markets in the world, however, the modern retail channels have not really developed in Vietnam, especially the convenience store. The enterprise business convenience store in Vietnam, meanwhile, is still in the stage of shaping development strategies in this market. This study focuses on the organizational challenges to convenience store chains in Vietnam. This study, therefore, was found that the competition from another retail sector, the inefficiency of the logistics system and supply chain, and the consumer cultures are these biggest challenges.

DE NFV; Network Function Virtualization; resource allocation; optimization
   and migration
AB Network service providers have to cope with the growing on-demand need from end-users as well as the diversity of usage. The softwerization and cloudification of the network components offer an interesting solution to achieve the agility necessary to dynamically match the requirement with the level of resource consumption. This materializes with the deployment of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) where Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) may be chained together to create network services. This paper explores important design and architectural issues related to this approach. We study the resource allocation problem in an NFV system for minimizing its cost under constraints on interconnectivity among VNFs, system resources, and service requirements. We formalize the problem in a comprehensive manner taking into account a broad set of relevant parameters. The static (offline) and dynamic (online) cases are considered. We propose and analyze three heuristic algorithms: two for handling large dimensions of the offline problem and one designed to address the online scenario.
   The evaluation shows that our solutions outperform the state of the art [1] with respect to critical performance index. Finally, we focus on the online scenario, evaluate the impact of migrating a set of running demands, and propose a simple migration technique.

DT Article
DE The minimum latency problem; Tabu search; Variable Neighborhood search
AB Minimum Latency Problem (MLP) is a class of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems which has many practical applications. In this paper, we investigate the global structure of the MLP solution space to propose a suitable meta-heuristic algorithm for the problem, which combines Tabu search (TS) and Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS). In the proposed algorithm, TS is used to prevent the search from getting trapped into cycles, and guide VNS to escape local optima. In a cooperative way, VNS is employed to generate diverse neighborhoods for TS. We also introduce a novel neighborhoods' structure for VNS and present a constant time operation for calculating the latency cost of each neighboring solution. Extensive numerical experiments and comparisons with the state of the art meta-heuristic algorithms in the literature show that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive, providing the new best solutions for several instances.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Genetic Programming (GP) has achieved success in evolving dispatching rules for job shop scheduling problems, particularly in dynamic environments. However, there is still great potential to improve the performance of GP. One challenge that is yet to be addressed is the huge search space. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of GP. The new approach is based on a newly defined time-invariance property of dispatching rules, which is derived from the idea of translational invariance from machine learning. Then, we develop a new terminal selection scheme to guarantee the time-invariance throughout the GP process. The experimental studies show that by considering the time-invariance, GP can achieve much better rules in a much shorter time.

DE Lightweight Ontologies; Possibility Theory; Belief Merging;
   Incommensurability
AB The context of this paper is the one of merging lightweight ontologies with prioritized or uncertain assertional bases issued from different sources. This is especially required when the assertions are provided by multiple and often conflicting sources having different reliability levels. We focus on the so-called egalitarian merging problem which aims to minimize the dissatisfaction degree of each individual source. The question addressed in this paper is how to merge prioritized assertional bases, in a possibility theory framework, when the uncertainty scales are not commensurable, namely when the sources do not share the same meaning of uncertainty scales. Using the notion of compatible scale, we provide a safe way to perform merging. The main result of the paper is that the egalitarian merging of prioritized assertional bases can be achieved in a polynomial time even if the uncertainty scales are not commensurable.

DE Cognitive Agent; Modern Manufacturing; Self-optimization
AB The new trend of the manufacturing system development is to apply autonomous behaviours inspired from biology for the manufacturing systems. In which, the resources of the manufacturing system are considered as biological organisms, which are autonomous entities so that the manufacturing system has the advanced characteristics inspired from biology such as self-adaptation, self-diagnosis, and self-optimization. To carry out these characteristics, the paper presents a paradigm about intelligent agent, called the cognitive agent and using cognitive agents for adapting to disturbances such as tool wear, machine breakdown that have happened on the shop floor. Modern manufacturing systems having the distributed control need autonomy and cooperation in solving problems of agents from agent technology, and cognitive capabilities for agents from cognitive technology. Cognitive agents combined from these two technologies are necessary for future manufacturing systems.

ID SMALL HUYGENS SOURCE; ARRAYS; DESIGN
AB A broadband electrically small antenna with directive circularly polarized radiation is presented. It is composed of a compact single-feed crossed dipole driver, which is backed by a near-field resonant parasitic (NFRP) reflector to achieve the directive radiation pattern. The NFRP reflector is designed to generate extra resonances and minimum axial ratio (AR) points in the antenna system. These features are combined with those resulting from the driver to broaden the operational bandwidth. The proposed antenna was fabricated and measured. The antenna prototype, with a low profile (0.066 lambda(o) at 1.45 GHz) and an electrically small size (ka = 0.71 at 1.45 GHz), has a measured |S-11| < -10 dB bandwidth of 25.66% (1.362-1.763 GHz) and a 3-dB AR bandwidth of 10.56% (1.390-1.545 GHz). Additionally, the measurements resulted in a broadside gain of 2.31 +/- 0.4 dBic and an average radiation efficiency of 80% within the operational bandwidth.

DE Service selection; E2E QoS constraints; QoS-aware; Min-max ant system
AB In this paper, we study the dynamic service composition becomes a decision problem on which component services should be selected under the E2E-to-End Quality of Service constraints. This problem is modeled is a nonlinear optimization problem under several constraints. We have two approaches to solve this problem. The first approach is local selection which is an efficient strategy with polynomial time complexity but can not handle global constraints. The second approach is the traditional global selection approach based on integer linear programming can handle global constraints, but its poor performance renders it inappropriate for practical applications with dynamic requirements. To overcome this disadvantage, in this study we proposed a novel Min-Max Ant System algorithm with the new utilities heuristic information to search the global approximate optimal. Our goal focus on its efficiency in terms of execution time and the quality in terms of the obtained best solution fitness value. The experiment results show that our algorithm is efficiency and feasibility more than the recently proposed related algorithms.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Burst assembly plays an important role in reducing the end-to-end delay of packets transported through optical burst switching (OBS) networks. Several methods have been proposed to reduce the delay of the packets buffered at ingress OBS nodes. However, these have created significant estimation errors, which result in wasting the reserved bandwidth or increasing the delay of excess packets. In this paper, we propose a model of optimal burst assembly for delay reduction, which minimizes the estimation error, eliminates the excess packets, and decreases the blocking probability of scheduling.

AB We study the performance of the secondary relay systemin a power-beacon (PB) assisted energy harvesting cognitive relay wireless network. In our system model, a secondary source node and a relay node first harvest energy from distributed PBs. Then, the source node transmits its data to the destination node with the help of the relay node. Also, fading coefficients of the links from the PBs to the source node and relay node are assumed independent but not necessarily identically distributed (i.n.i.d) Nakagami-m random variables. We derive exact expressions for the power outage probability and the channel outage probability. Based on that, we analyze the total outage probability of the secondary relay system. Asymptotic analysis is also performed, which provides insights into the system behavior. Moreover, we evaluate impacts of the primary network on the performance of the secondary network with respect to the tolerant interference threshold at the primary receiver as well as the interference introduced by the primary transmitter at the secondary source and relay nodes. Simulation results are provided to validate the analysis.

AB One of the most vital aspects of navigation problem is path planning, in which we must be able to find the optimal path with minimum total transitions cost from the start to goal. This paper introduces the state-of-the-art D*Lite algorithm and presents the efficiency problem of D*Lite in complex environments, particularly in dynamic maze-like environments, where the effect of changes is costly. We propose the new algorithm D* Lite with Reset (D*LR) with two different criteria for resetting. We prove experimentally the performance improvement of D*LR over D* Lite in complex environments. Further implementation of D*LR on both Processing simulator and robotics framework ROS is also presented.

AB In this paper, we introduce an approach for robot head mechanism using a parallel mini-manipulator model to establish a highly efficient multiple angle view functionality for robot vision systems. In order to demonstrate the abilities of the structure, we implement the well-known Eigenfaces and Haarcascade algorithms for real-time tracking, localizing, and recognizing problems on human-robot interaction (e. g grasping and manipulation in autonomous robots). The advantages of these algorithms are the guaranty of high-speed face detection with also high accuracy, which proposed to be robust and efficient. The system could be integrated into Robot Operating System (ROS) so that we can control many kinds of peripherals signal more effectively. Furthermore, ROS provides our system with scalability for further development more effectively.

AB When vehicles are located on the edge of cells or in areas without network coverage, it's difficult for them to access to cellular network and communicate with base stations. To solve the problem, this paper takes the characteristics of LTE-V network and the high-speed mobility of VANETs into consideration, and establishes a model of coalitional game with transferable payoff. In the design of utility function, we also consider the expected throughput of nodes and transmission delay, and propose a multi-objective coalition formation algorithm. The simulation results show that the message distribution mechanism can solve the multi-objective optimization problem proposed in the paper effectively, and enable more vehicles to receive required messages in short time.

ID RULES
AB Mining frequent closed sequential pattern (FCSPs) has attracted a great deal of research attention, because it is an important task in sequences mining. In recently, many studies have focused on mining frequent closed sequential patterns because, such patterns have proved to be more efficient and compact than frequent sequential patterns. Information can be fully extracted from frequent closed sequential patterns. In this paper, we propose an efficient parallel approach called parallel dynamic bit vector frequent closed sequential patterns (pDBV-FCSP) using multi-core processor architecture for mining FCSPs from large databases. The pDBV-FCSP divides the search space to reduce the required storage space and performs closure checking of prefix sequences early to reduce execution time for mining frequent closed sequential patterns. This approach overcomes the problems of parallel mining such as overhead of communication, synchronization, and data replication. It also solves the load balance issues of the workload between the processors with a dynamic mechanism that re-distributes the work, when some processes are out of work to minimize the idle CPU time.

AB This article describes using of new approach to automatic classification of big data records in Be and B[e] stars spectra in large astrophysical archives. With enormous amount of these data it is no longer feasible to analyse it using classical approaches. We introduce evolutionary synthesis of the classification by means of so called analytic programming (AP), one of methods of symbolic regression. By using this method, we synthesise the most suitable mathematical models that approximate chosen samples of the stellar spectra. As a result is then selected the class whose synthesised formula has the lowest difference (i.e. the most similar) compared to the particular spectrum. The results show us that classification of stellar spectra by means of AP is able to identify different shapes of the spectra and classify them.

AB This paper is an extended and updated version, presented at the INDIA 2017 conference. Optimal resource provisioning for virtual services in the Cloud computing is one of the concerns nowadays. For cloud computing service providers, reducing the number of physical machines providing resources for virtual services in cloud computing is one of the efficient ways to reduce the amount of energy consumption, which in turn enhances the performance of data centers. Multidimensional resource provisioning on a Heterogeneous Shared Hosting Platforms for virtual services is known as a NP-hard problem. Therefore, it is necessary to apply the metaheuristic algorithms for estimating the outcome of the problem. In this study, we propose the resource allocation problem for reducing the energy consumption. ECRA-SA algorithms were designed to solve it and were evaluated through CloudSim simulation tool compared with FFD algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed ECRA-SA algorithm yields a better performance than FFD algorithm.

DE description logic learning; parallel; symmetric; exception
ID REFINEMENT
AB In machine learning, one often encounters data sets where a general pattern is violated by a relatively small number of exceptions (for example, a rule that says that all birds can fly is violated by examples such as penguins). This complicates the concept learning process and may lead to the rejection of some simple and expressive rules that cover many cases. In this paper we present an approach to this problem in description logic learning by computing partial descriptions (which are not necessarily entirely complete) of both positive and negative examples and combining them. Our Symmetric Parallel Class Expression Learning approach enables the generation of general rules with exception patterns included. We demonstrate that this algorithm provides significantly better results (in terms of metrics such as accuracy, search space covered, and learning time) than standard approaches on some typical data sets. Further, the approach has the added bene fit that it can be parallelised relatively simply, leading to much faster exploration of the search tree on modern computers.

AB In this paper, the problems of full-order and reduced-order positive state estimations are developed for discrete-time positive Markov jump linear systems with delay. By establishing a positive time-delay system for 1-moment function of the state vector, delay-dependent necessary and sufficient exponential stability conditions are first derived based on a comparison technique for positive systems. Then, on the basis of the derived stability conditions, the problems of designing positive state observers in full-order and reduced-order for positive Markov jump systems with delay are addressed. The existence conditions of positive observers and the design schemes are formulated in terms of linear programming problems which can be effectively solved by various optimisation algorithms to obtain the observer parameters. Finally, three numerical examples with simulations are given to validate the analysis and design results.

AB In this paper, we study crucial elements of a complex network, namely its nodes and connections, which play a key role in maintaining the network's structure and function under unexpected structural perturbations of nodes and edges removal. Specifically, we want to identify vital nodes and edges whose failure (either random or intentional) will break the most number of connected triples (or triangles) in the network. This problem is extremely important, because connected triples form the foundation of strong connections in many real-world systems, such as mutual relationships in social networks, reliable data transmission in communication networks, and stable routing strategies in mobile networks. Disconnected triples, analog to broken mutual connections, can greatly affect the network's structure and disrupt its normal function, which can further lead to the corruption of the entire system. The analysis of such crucial elements will shed light on key factors behind the resilience and robustness of many complex systems in practice. We formulate the analysis under multiple optimization problems and show their intractability. We next propose efficient approximation algorithms, namely, DAK-n and DAK-e, which guarantee an (1 - 1/e)-approximate ratio (compared with the overall optimal solutions) while having the same time complexity as the best triangle counting and listing algorithm on power-law networks. This advantage makes our algorithms scale extremely well even for very large networks. In an application perspective, we perform comprehensive experiments on real social traces with millions of nodes and billions of edges. Empirical results indicate that our approaches achieve comparably better solution quality while are up to 100x faster than the current state-of-the-art methods.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore themes eventuating from the user-generated content posted by users on the Facebook page of an emergency management agency.
   Design/methodology/approach - An information classification framework was used to classify user-generated content posted by users including all of the content posted during a six month period (January to June 2015). The posts were read and analysed thematically to determine the overarching themes evident across the entire collection of user posts. Findings - The results of the analysis demonstrate that the key themes that eventuate fromthe user-generated content posted are "Self-preparedness", "Emergency signalling solutions", "Unsurpassable companion", "Aftermath of an emergency", and "Gratitude towards emergency management staff". Major user-generated content identified among these themes are status- update, criticism, recommendation, and request.
   Research limitations/implications - This study contributes to theory on the development of key themes from user-generated content posted by users on a public social networking site. An analysis of user-generated content identified in this study implies that, Facebook is primarily used for information dissemination, coordination and collaboration, and information seeking in the context of emergency management. Users may gain the benefits of identity construction and social provisions, whereas social conflict is a potential detrimental implication. Other user costs include lack of social support by stakeholders, investment in social infrastructure and additional work force required to alleviate the technological, organisational, and social barriers in communication among stakeholders in emergency management. A collective activity system built upon the Activity Theory was used as a lens to describe users' activity of posting content on the Facebook page of an emergency management agency.
   Practical implications - By analysing the findings, administrators and policy makers of emergency management could identify the extent to which the core principles of disaster recovery are accomplished using public social networking sites. These are achieved in relation to: pre-disaster recovery planning; partnership and inclusiveness; public information messaging; unity of effort; and, psychological recovery to maximise the success of recovery in a disaster. Furthermore, a core principle which evoked a mixed response was timeliness and flexibility.
   Originality/value - Previous studies have examined the role of social networking sites in disastrous situations, but to date there has been very little research into determining themes found in user- generated content posted on the Facebook page of an emergency management agency. Hence, this study addresses the gap in literature by conducting a thematic analysis of user-generated content posted on the Facebook page of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

AB This paper provides a fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (FMCDM) method for evaluating financial statement quality (FSQ). Current research rarely applied the multi-criteria evaluation method to evaluate FSQ, and the fuzzyness was ignored. Accordingly, this paper develops a FMCDM method for FSQ. Firstly, an evaluation index system is established based on the key qualitative characteristics of financial reporting information defined by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The evaluation index system contains four criteria, which are relevance, reliability, comparability, and understandability. After that, this paper develops an intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging operator for weighting criteria, and a fuzzy distance-based method for weighting evaluators' judgements. Thereafter, this paper uses a revised TOPSIS method to aggregate all the qualitative ratings. A practical case study is used to test the feasibility of the methodology. Finally, we discuss the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with previous FSQ evaluation approaches, the proposed FMCDM method takes more aspects into consideration, and has significant advantages.

AB This paper presents a wavelet cerebellar model articulation controller (WCMAC) based adaptive control design for nonlinear systems using a particle swarm optimization (PSO). The WCMAC is the main tracking controller and a robust compensation controller is used to compensate for the residual error. In the WCMAC, the adaptive laws of controller parameters are derived using the gradient descent method. However, the initial values of learning rates of these adaptive laws are very important and they affect much to the performance of control systems. In this paper, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to find the optimal learning rates of the parameter adaptation laws. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, numerical simulations of magnetic levitation system and inverted pendulum are provided to confirm the applications of the proposed PSO-WCMAC-based control system. The superiority of the proposed control scheme is also evaluated by quantitative comparison with other control schemes.

AB Cloud computing has emerged as an optimal option for almost all computational problems today. Using cloud services, customers and providers come to terms of usage conditions defined in Service Agreement Layer (SLA), which specifies acceptable Quality of Service (QoS) metric levels. From the view of cloud-based software developers, their application-level SLA must be mapped to provided virtual resource-level SLA. Hence, one of the important challenges in clouds today is to improve QoS of computing resources. In this paper, we focus on developing a comprehensive autoscaling solution for clouds based on forecasting resource consumption in advance and validating prediction-based scaling decisions. Our prediction model takes all advantages of fuzzy approach, genetic algorithm and neural network to process historical monitoring time series data. After that the scaling decisions are validated and adapted through evaluating SLA violations. Our solution is tested on real workload data generated from Google data center. The achieved results show significant efficiency and feasibility of our model. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

DE Semi-supervised clustering; Multi-label classification (MLC); Specific
   feature; Semi-supervised multi-label classification
AB Multi-label Classification (MLC), which recently has attracted numerous attentions, aims at building classification models for objects assigned with multiple class labels simultaneously. Existing approaches for MLC mainly focus on improving supervised learning which needs a relatively large amount of labeled data for training. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised MLC algorithm to exploit unlabeled data for enhancing the performance. In the training process, our algorithm exploits the specific features per prominent class label chosen by a greedy approach as an extension of LIFT algorithm, and unlabeled data consumption mechanism from TESC. In classification, the 1-Nearest-Neighbor (1NN) is applied to select appropriate class labels for a new data instance. Our experimental results on a data set of hotel (for tourism) reviews indicate that a reasonable amount of unlabeled data helps to increase the F1 score. Interestingly, with a small amount of labeled data, our algorithm can reach comparative performance to a larger amount of labeled data.

DE CNN; KDES; Plant identification
AB This paper proposes a combination of deep learning and hand-designed feature for plant identification based on leaf and flower images. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, for each organ image, we have performed a comparative evaluation of deep learning and hand-designed feature for plant identification. Two approaches for deep learning and hand-designed feature that are convolutional neuron network (CNN) and kernel descriptor (KDES) are chosen in our experiments. Second, based on the results of the first contribution, we propose a method for plant identification by late fusing the identification results of leaf and flower. Experimental results on ImageClef 2015 dataset show that hand designed feature outperforms deep learning for well-constrained cases (leaf captured on simple background). However, deep learning shows its robustness in natural situations. Moreover, the combination of leaf and flower images improves significantly the identification when comparing leaf-based plant identification.

ID LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION
AB Hidden topic models, the method to automatically detect the topics which are (hidden in a text) represented by words, have been successfully in many text mining tasks including text classification. They help to get the semantics of text by abstracting the words in text into topics. Another new method for text representation is distance graph model, which has the ability of preserving the local order of words in text, thus, enhancing the text semantics. This paper proposes a method to combine both hidden topic and distance graph models for opinion mining in hotel review domain using multi-label classification approach. Experiments show the efficiency of the proposed model provides a better performance of 4% than that of the baseline.

AB Multi-sentence compression is the task of generating a single sentence from a set of sentences about the same topic. In this work, we explore the use of syntax factor in combination with informativeness and linguistic quality in an Integer Linear Programming framework. Compression candidate paths generated by a word graph are re-ranked using frequent words. Then top k-shortest paths are used as the variables for Integer Linear Programming formulation. Our system improves over state of the art in both English and Vietnamese datasets.

AB Access control is one of the most efficient ways to restrict resource access violations. However, in software development process, programs may not be fully complied with access policies represented in specifications. In this paper, we present an approach to verify the access policies compliance between a SecureUML model and its software program. We extract access control rules specified in SecureUML model, analyze source code of its program and propose an algorithm to check the compliance between two paradigms. Our approach can help programmers to detect some resource access violations and to improve the quality of software systems.

DE Genetic algorithm; Path coverage testing; Automatic test data generation
AB Search-based testing techniques using genetic algorithm (GA) can automatically generate test data that achieves high coverage on almost any given program under test. GA casts the path coverage test data generation as an optimization problem and applies efficient search-based algorithms to find suitable test cases. GA approaches scale well and can handle any source code and test criteria, but it still has some degrades when program under test has critical path clusters. This paper presents a method for improving GA efficiency by integrating a constraint solver to solve path conditions in which regular GA cannot generate test data for coverage. The proposed approach is also applied to some programs under test. Experimental results demonstrate that improved GA can generate suitable test data has higher path coverage than the regular one.

AB This paper proposes an automated test cases generation method from sequence diagrams and class diagrams with string constraints. The method supports UML 2.0 sequence diagrams including twelve combined fragments. An algorithm for generating test scenarios are developed to avoid test paths explosion without having data sharing points of threads in parallel fragments or weak sequencing fragments. Test data are also generated with solving constraints of string variables. We standardize string constraints and equations at the boundary of variables that are input formula of Z3-str solver. Comparing with the current approach of the solver, some preprocessing rules are extended for other operations such as charAt, lastin-dexOf, trim, starts With and ends With. If a result of the Z3-str is SAT, test data of each test scenario are generated to satisfy the constraints with boundary coverage. A tool is implemented to support the proposed method, and some experiments are also presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the tool.

AB The assume-guarantee verification has been recognized as a promising method for solving the state space explosion in modular model checking of component-based software. However, the counterexample analysis technique used in this method has huge complexity and the computational cost for generating assumptions is very high. As a result, the method is difficult to be applied in practice. Therefore, this paper presents two improvements of the assume-guarantee verification method in order to solve the above problems. The first one is a counterexample analysis method that is simple to implement but effective enough to prevent the verification process from infinite loops when considering the last action of counterexample as suffix in implementation. This is done by finding a suffix that can make the observation table not closed when being added to the suffix set of the table and use that suffix for the learning process. The second one is a reduction of the number of membership queries to be asked to teacher when learning assumptions. This results in a significantly faster speed in generating assumption than that of the original algorithm. An implemented tool and experimental results are also described to show the effectiveness of the improvements.

AB The field of thermo-electric coolers (TEC) has grown drastically in recent years. In an extreme environment such as thermal energy and gas drilling operations, TEC is an effective cooling mechanism for instruments. Nevertheless, limitations such as the relatively low energy conversion efficiency and ability to dissipate only a limited amount of heat flux may seriously damage the lifetime and performance of the instrument. Many researches were conducted to expand the efficiency of TEC. The material parameters are the most significant, but they are restricted by currently available materials and module fabricating technologies. Therefore, the main objective of finding the optimal TEC design is to define a set of design parameters. In this paper, technical issues of TEC were discussed. After that, a new method of optimising the dimension of TEC using simulated annealing (SA), to maximise the cooling rate was proposed. Equality constraint and inequality constraint were taken into consideration. This work reveals that SA performs better than genetic algorithm in terms of stability and reliability and found a better geometric design of single-stage TEC which maximise cooling rate when compared with Cheng's (2005) work.

AB This paper presents an intelligent call distributor. This system can route calls to the most appropriate agent according to routing rules constructed by a text classifier. The system includes four main components: a telephone communication network; speech recognition; a text classifier; and a speech synthesizer. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first systems in Vietnam to implement an integrated mechanism using both text language processing and spoken language processing. This allows voice applications to be intelligent and to be able to communicate with humans in natural language with high accuracy and reasonable speed. After building and testing, the system is shown to have an accuracy of 92%.

AB Belief merging is one of active research fields with a large range of applications in Artificial Intelligence. Most of the work in this research field is in the centralized approach, however, it is difficult to apply to interactive systems such as multi-agent systems. In this paper, we introduce a new argumentation framework for belief merging. To this end, a constructive model to merge possiblistic belief bases built based on the famous general argumentation framework is proposed. An axiomatic model, including a set of rational and intuitive postulates to characterize the merging result is introduced and several logical properties are mentioned and discussed.

DE Recommendation system; Collaboration; Consensus; Integration
AB With the development of scientific societies, research problems are increasingly complex, requiring scientists to collaborate to solve them. The quality of collaboration between researchers is a major factor in determining their achievements. This study proposes a collaboration recommendation method that takes into account previous research collaboration and research similarities. Research collaboration is measured by combining the collaboration time and the number of co-authors who already collaborated with an author. Research similarity is based on authors' previous publications and academic events they attended. In addition, a consensus-based algorithm is proposed to integrate bibliography data from different sources, such as the DBLP Computer Science Bibliography, ResearchGate, CiteSeer, and Google Scholar. The experimental results show that this proposal improves the accuracy of the recommendation systems, in comparison with other methods.

   Unstructured text
AB Sentiment analysis from the text is an exciting and challenging task which can be useful in many applications of exploiting people interests for improving the quality of services. Especially, text collected from social networks, websites or forums is usually represented by spoken language that is unstructured and difficult to handle. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid model that is based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) and adopts a combination of lexicon-based and Support Vector Machine (SVM) methods in the task of topic-based sentiment classification for Vietnamese text. The proposed model has been evaluated on five different topic-datasets, and the experimental results show the efficiency of our proposed model when the average accuracy is nearly 87%. Although this proposed model is initially designed for Vietnamese language, it is applicable and adaptable to other languages.

ID TOPIC MODELS
AB This paper evaluates through an empirical study eight different distance measures used on the LDA+K-means model. We performed our analysis on two miscellaneous datasets that are commonly used. Our experimental results indicate that the probabilistic-based distance measures are better than the vector based distance measures including Euclidean when it comes to cluster a set of documents in the topic space. Moreover, we investigate the implication of the number of topics and show that K-means combined to the results of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model allows us to have better results than the LDA+Naive and Vector Space Model.

ID SEQUENCES
AB Mining patterns in sequence databases are one of the fields that many researchers study due to their high applicability in many areas such as trademarks, medical, education, or prediction. However, the main challenge of this is runtime and memory usage. Many approaches are proposed to improve the efficiency of mining algorithms. However, another issue needs to be studied further. In this paper, we propose a method of effectively solving the problem of sequential pattern mining, based on the event information represented in the vertical data format of the sequence dataset. With a proposed state table, a map table of co-occurrence of events and an early pruning search space technique, the paper proposes the efficiency mining algorithm called STATE-SPADE. The experimental results have shown the advantages of the proposed method in terms of execution time and memory usage.

DE Data mining; Periodic high utility sequential patterns; Periodic
   patterns; High utility sequential patterns
AB The aim of mining High Utility Sequential Patterns (HUSPs) is to discover sequential patterns having a high utility (e.g. high profit) based on a user-specified minimum utility threshold. The existing algorithms for mining HUSPs are capable of discovering the complete set of all HUSPs. However, they usually generate a large number of patterns which may be redundant in some cases. The periodic appearance of HUSPs can be regarded as an important criterion to consider the purchase behaviour of customers and measure the interestingness of HUSPs which is very common in real-life applications. In this paper, we focus on periodic high utility sequential patterns (PHUSPs) that are periodically bought by customers and generate a high profit. We proposed an algorithm named PHUSPM (Periodic High Utility Sequential Patterns Miner) to efficiently discover all PHUSPs. The experimental evaluation was performed on six large-scale datasets to evaluate the performance of PHUSPM in terms of execution time, memory usages and scalability. The experimental results show that the PHUSPM algorithm is very efficient by reducing the search space and discarding a considerable amount of non-PHUSPs.

AB Constraint-based methods for mining class association rules (CARs) have been developed in recent years. Currently, there are two kinds of constraints including itemset constraints and class constraints. In this paper, we solve the problem of combination of class constraints and itemset constraints are called synthesis constraints. It is done by applying class constraints and removing rules that do not satisfy itemset constraints after that. This process will consume more time when the number of rules is large. Therefore, we propose a method to mine all rules satisfying these two constraints by one-step, i.e., we will put these two constraints in the process of mining CARs. The lattice is also used to fast generate CARs. Experimental results show that our approach is more efficient than mining CARs using two steps.

AB This paper presents a method for daily living activity prediction based on boosting discriminative models. The system consists of several steps. First, local feature descriptors are extracted from multiple scales of the sequent images. In this experiment, the basic feature descriptors based on HOG, HOF, MBH are considered to process. Second, local features based BoW descriptors are studied to construct feature vectors, which are then fed to classification machine. The BoW feature extraction is a pre-processing step, which is utilized to avoid strong correlation data, and to distinguish feature properties for uniform data for classification machine. Third, a discriminative model is constructed using the BoW features, which is based on the individual local descriptor. Sequentially, final decision of action classes is done by the classifier using boosting discriminative models. Different to previous contributions, the sequent-overlap frames are considered to convolute and infer action classes instead of an individual set of frames is used for prediction. An advantage of boosting is that it supports to construct a strong classifier based on a set of weak classifiers associated with appropriate weights to obtain results in high performance. The method is successfully tested on some standard databases.

DE Multi-relational data; Matrix factorization; Recommender Systems
AB Matrix factorization technique has been successfully used in recommender systems. Currently, many variations are developed using this technique, e.g., biased matrix factorization, non-negative matrix factorization, multi-relational matrix factorization, etc. In the context of multi-relational data, this paper proposes another multi-relational approach for recommender systems by including all of the information from latent factor matrices to the prediction functions so that the models have more data to learn. To validate the proposed approach, experiments are conducted on standard datasets in recommender systems. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is promising.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM
AB The computational requirements even in the limited resources of the hardware devices whose small memory size or low price could be addressed by compact optimization methods. In this paper, a compact particle swarm optimization (cPSO) for the base station locations optimization is proposed for wireless sensor networks (WSN). A probabilistic representation random of the collection behavior of swarms is inspired to employ for this proposed algorithm. The real population is replaced with the probability vector updated based on single competition. These lead to the entire algorithm functioning applying a modest memory usage. The experiments to solve the problem of locating the base station in WSN compared with the genetic algorithm (GA) method and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method show that the proposed method can provide the effective way of using a modest memory.

AB In the past, a SKYMINE approach was proposed to both consider the aspects of utility and frequency of the itemsets to mine the skyline frequency-utility skyline patterns (SFUPs). The SKYMINE algorithm requires, however, the amounts of computation to mine the SFUPs based on the utility-pattern (UP)-tree structure performing in a level-wise manner. In this paper, we propose more effective algorithms to mine the SFUPs based on the utility-list structure. Substantial experiments are carried to show that the proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art SKYMINE to mine the SFUPs in terms of runtime and memory usage.

AB For the environment of robot motion, workspace consisted of the positions and shapes of obstacles, optimization for robot operations requires not only one criteria but also several criteria. In this paper, a novel multi-objective method for optimal robot path planning is proposed based on Grey wolf optimizer (GWO). Two criteria of distance and smooth path of the robot path planning issue are transformed into a minimization one for fitness function. The position of the globally best agent in each iterative can be reached by the robot in sequence permutation. Series simulations are implemented in different static environments for the optimal path when the robot reaches its target. The results show that the proposed method provides the robot reaches its target with colliding free obstacles and the alternative method of optimization for robot planning.

AB Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been envisioned as the emerging technology and applied widely, but they also faced many practical challenges. One of such challenges is the coverage issue because of a high coverage rate ensures a high quality of service of the WSN. This paper proposes a novel method to optimize sensor coverage based on the enhanced diversity herds grey wolf optimizer (EGWO). In the proposed method, coverage overlaps and holes of deploying WSN are considered to a mathematical model for the objective function of the optimization problem. Quality performance of the proposed method is evaluated through simulation in several scenarios of WSN. The simulation results compared with other methods such as the grey wolf optimizer and the genetic algorithm shows that the proposed algorithm achieves a good coverage and a competitor.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM
AB Purpose - Service-oriented architecture is an emerging software architecture, in which web service (WS) plays a crucial role. In this architecture, the task of WS composition and verification is required when handling complex requirement of services from users. When the number of WS becomes very huge in practice, the complexity of the composition and verification is also correspondingly high. In this paper, the authors aim to propose a logic-based clustering approach to solve this problem by separating the original repository of WS into clusters. Moreover, they also propose a so-called quality-controlled clustering approach to ensure the quality of generated clusters in a reasonable execution time.
   Design/methodology/approach - The approach represents WSs as logical formulas on which the authors conduct the clustering task. They also combine two most popular clustering approaches of hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) and k-means to ensure the quality of generated clusters.
   Findings - This logic-based clustering approach really helps to increase the performance of the WS composition and verification significantly. Furthermore, the logic-based approach helps us to maintain the soundness and completeness of the composition solution. Eventually, the quality-controlled strategy can ensure the quality of generated clusters in low complexity time.
   Research limitations/implications - The work discussed in this paper is just implemented as a research tool known as WSCOVER. More work is needed to make it a practical and usable system for real life applications.
   Originality/value - In this paper, the authors propose a logic-based paradigm to represent and cluster WSs. Moreover, they also propose an approach of quality-controlled clustering which combines and takes advantages of two most popular clustering approaches of HAC and k-means.

AB This paper presents a new approach of dynamic clustering based on improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and which is applied to image segmentation (called DCPSONS). Firstly, the original PSO algorithm is improved by using diversity mechanism and neighborhood search strategy. The improved PSO is then combined with the well-known data clustering k-means algorithm for dynamic clustering problem where the number of clusters has not yet been known. Finally, DCPSONS is applied to image segmentation problem, in which the number of clusters is automatically determined. Experimental results in using sixteen benchmark data sets and several images of synthetic and natural benchmark data demonstrate that the proposed DCPSONS algorithm substantially outperforms other competitive algorithms in terms of accuracy and convergence rate.

TI Instance reduction for time series classification using MDL principle

AB Research in time series classification has shown that the one nearest neighbor with Dynamic Time Warping measure in most cases outperforms more advanced classification algorithms. Instance reduction is one of the approaches to improve time and space efficiency of nearest neighbor classifier for time series data. This approach reduces the size of the training set by selecting the best representative instances and uses only them during classification of new instances. In this work, we propose a novel approach for instance reduction in time series classification. Our method consists of two steps. First, we remove the unrepresentative instances in the training set, using data editing. In the second step, we compress the training set using the Minimum Description Length principle. The main idea behind our method is that if we can compress the two time series by the Minimum Description Length principle, we will combine them into one time series. By this way, the number of instances in the training set is reduced step by step, and we stop removing instances from the training set when reaching some required percentage of instances in the training set or when we can not find any pair of instances to compress. We empirically compare our proposed method with the two previous methods, INSIGHT and Naive Rank Reduction, over a vast majority number of time series training sets. The experimental results show that our method can outperform INSIGHT and Naive Rank Reduction in many datasets when the percentage of selected instances in the training set is not too small, about greater than 30%.

ID PARTIAL SUPERVISION; ALGORITHMS
AB Active learning for semi-supervised clustering allows algorithms to solicit a domain expert to provide side information as instances constraints, for example a set of labeled instances called seeds. The problem consists in selecting the queries to the expert that are likely to improve either the relevance or the quality of the proposed clustering. However, these active methods suffer from several limitations: (i) they are generally tailored for only one specific clustering paradigm or cluster shape and size, (ii) they may be counter-productive if the seeds are not selected in an appropriate manner and, (iii) they have to work efficiently with minimal expert supervision. In this paper, we propose a new active seed selection algorithm that relies on a k-nearest neighbors structure to locate dense potential clusters and efficiently query and propagate expert information. Our approach makes no hypothesis about the underlying data distribution and can be paired with any clustering algorithm. Comparative experiments conducted on real data sets show the efficiency of this new approach compared to existing ones.

AB Recent evidences suggest that complex behavior such as chaos can be observed in a nonlinear system with stable equilibria. However, few studies have investigated chaotic systems with only one stable equilibrium. This paper introduces a new 3-D chaotic system having only one stable equilibrium. Dynamics of the new system are discovered by using phase portraits, basin of attraction, bifurcation diagram, and maximal Lyapunov exponents. It is interesting that the system has a state variable related with the freedom of offset boosting. In addition, we have investigated the anti-synchronization of the system via an adaptive control. Furthermore, the feasibility of the system is also discussed through presenting its electronic circuit implementation.

   SEGMENTATION
AB Automatic segmentation of major brain tissues from high-resolution magnetic resonance images (MRIs) plays an important role in clinical diagnostics and neuroscience research. In this paper, we present a novel approach to extract brain tissues including gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid by using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), Convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Deep neural networks (DNNs). GMMs are applied to classify voxels which have distinct intensity information and are easy to recognize while DNNs and CNNs are treating voxels which are similar in appearance and usually recognized insufficiently by traditional approaches. The empirical results on IBSR 18 dataset show that the proposed method outperforms 13 state-of-the-art algorithms, surpassing all other methods by a significant margin.

AB Industrial machines are generally expensive to implement due to their requirement of being fast and robust. In this paper, we proposed a new approach to the problem, particularly, a walnut sorting machine that was built cheaply using open solution. On hardware side, we used readily available electronics and on the software side, Robot Operating System was adopted to handle low level hardware abstraction. Machine Learning, Computer Vision and data processing techniques were implemented on top of them using high level programming language. This resulted in a highly functional, easy to maintain yet inexpensive walnuts sorting machine - which was confirmed by our Austrian partner's testing. This success, hopefully, will pave the way for more projects using similar approaches.

ID ELASTICITY
AB Mechanical properties of tissues in terms of elasticity and viscosity provide us useful information which may be used in detecting tumors. Shear wave imaging (SWI) is a new method to quantify tissue elasticity by estimating the parameters of the complex shear modulus (CSM). The shear wave is generated by a vibrating needle at a certain frequency. In fact, CSM is a function of the vibrating frequency. Therefore, in this paper, a frequency dependent investigation of CSM will be carried in order to evaluate the estimation performance. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is designed to estimate the CSM for both homogeneous and heterogeneous mediums. The root mean square (rms) error is used to evaluate the quality of the CSM estimation. Several tests were implemented to determine the range of vibrating frequency should be used for the good estimation.

DE Automated software; HTTP traffic clustering; Communication identifying;
   Malware detection
AB Application developer has trend to take advantage of web as a communication medium environment to reach users because HTTP protocol is mostly allowed in any network environment nowadays. Unfortunately, cyber criminal is also fully exploit HTTP protocol to launch variety of forbidden actions such as application level attacks or spreading malware. Consequently, normal and malicious HTTP automated software (auto-ware) traffic are transparently merged with each other. Clustering and identifying between HTTP communication are raised as serious challenge in order to early investigate internal threats. In this paper, access graph and key features are suggested, based on which HTTP auto-ware communication behavior are recognized. From there, a novelty method in clustering and identifying HTTP auto-ware is presented. Experiment shows promising results since not just malicious communications are detected but also grayware traffic are clustered into groups and identified as their purposes.

ID MODEL
AB Insurance forecasting is a matter of vital importance to insurance companies for analyzing of annual income, premium and loss reserving, loss payment, etc. Recent years have also seen increasing discussion within the actuarial community of the need for insurance forecasting techniques that are more solidly grounded in rigorous machine learning methodologies. Taking advantages of knowledge-reuse and learning capability for dealing with uncertainties, hybridization of neural networks and fuzzy logic could enhance the accuracy of forecasting for insurance applications. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-fuzzy inference system for insurance forecasting. It uses multiple parameter sets where each set is responsible for a small subset of records. The aim of each parameter set is to minimize Mean Square Error within records of the subset. The learning strategy and a rule reduction method are also proposed. Empirically validation on the benchmark and real insurance datasets show the advantages of the new system.

AB Protein prenylation is the addition of hydrophobic molecules to a protein or chemical compound. It is a post-translational modification that plays very important roles for many cellular processes such as DNA replication, signaling, trafficking, and other cellular functions in eukaryotes. Protein S-farnesyl cysteine prenylation is a specific kind of prenylation involved in the transfer of a farnesyl moiety to a cytoplasmic cysteine at or near the C-terminus of the target protein. Recent advancements in proteomic technology have stimulated an increasing interested in the identification of protein S-farnesyl cysteine prenylation sites. However, there is still a lack of methods proposed for the prediction of S-farnesyl cysteine sites. With a rapidly increasing number of experimentally verified S-farnesyl cysteine sites, it is motivated in proposed new method for identifying S-farnesyl cysteine prenylation sites.

AB In the past few decades, boosting crop yield has been extensively regarded in many agricultural countries, especially Vietnam. Due to food demands and impossibility of crop-field area increasing, precision farming is essential to improve agricultural production and productivity. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on some advanced techniques including deep learning, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assess the quality of Vietnamese rice fields. UAVs are responsible for taking images of the rice fields at low or very low altitudes. Then, these images with high resolution will be processed by the deep neural networks on high performance computing systems. The main task of deep neural networks is to classify the images into many classes corresponding to low and high qualities of the rice fields. To conduct experimental results, the rice fields located in Tay Ninh province are chosen as a case study. The experimental results indicate that this approach is quite appropriate for agricultural Vietnamese practice since its accuracy is approximately 0.72.

ID RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS
AB Recommender systems are the auto systems of providing appropriate information and removing unappropriate information for users. The recommender systems are built based on two main information filtering techniques: Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. Content-based filtering performs effectively on documents representing as text but has problems to select information features on multimedia data. Collaborative filtering perform well on all types of information but had problems when sparse data, new uses and new items. In this paper, we propose a new unify model between collaborative filtering and content-based filtering by a semi-supervised learning method. The model is built based on two semi-supervised procedures: the first procedure semi-supervise ratings set between users and item's features, the second procedure semi-supervise ratings set between items and users features. The first procedure allows us to detect new items that is high suitable capability with the users. The second procedure allows us to detect new users that is high suitable ability with the items. Two procedures performed simultaneously and complement each other for suitable predicted values to improve recommender results. The experimental results on real data sets show that the proposed methods utilize effectively the advantages and limit significant disadvantages of baseline filtering methods.

AB In this paper, we propose a variation on the fitness function in Genetic Programming based on Bias-Variance Genetic Programming (BVGP) [2], called BVGP*. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this variation, we compare it with Genetic Programming [1] and Bias-Variance Genetic Programming (BVGP) [2]. The experimental results shown that the learned model by BVGP* is better than that of GP and BVGP in ability to generalize, model complexity and evaluation time.

AB Traditionally, 3-D overhead crane systems are widely used in industry and automatic operation would reduce the risk. It is difficult to precisely position the payload in overhead crane due to the lack of actuators in this system. This paper develops an adaptive robust ability of high - order sliding mode controller (HOSMC). The finite time stability of the closed-loop system is proved without traditional Lyapunov theory. The results based on suitable second-order sliding surface and super twisting controller. Simulation studies are performed to demonstrate the validity of the proposed control scheme.

ID POSTURE RECOGNITION
AB Hand posture recognition is an active research topic in computer vision and robotics with many applications ranging from automatic sign language recognition to human-system interaction. Recently, we have proposed a new descriptor for hand representation based on the kernel method (KDES) [1]. Our new descriptor inherits the main idea of KDES but we proposed three improvements to make it more robust. One of the improvements was that we introduced a new hand pyramid structure [14]. Intuitively, hand pyramid is more suitable to hand structure than conventional pyramid. In our previous work, we have demonstrated that the combination of improvements to KDES gives more accurate hand posture classification than using original KDES. However, it still lacks discussions and experimental evidences of the contribution of hand pyramid for hand representation. In this paper, we build specific hand dataset and conduct more experiments to show how hand pyramid contributes for hand representation. We will discuss deeply on the results and analyze the impact of this pyramid on hand posture classification.

AB Fuzzy forecasting approaches are mainly based on the modeling of fuzzy logical relationships of the historical data. In this paper, an improved model for forecasting stock market indices which combines the High-order Time-Variant Fuzzy Logical Relationship Groups (HV-FLRGs) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is presented. Firstly, HV-FLRGs are more effective to capture fuzzy relations on time series data than the conventional time-invariant fuzzy logical relationship groups. Secondly, PSO is employed to optimize the length of intervals by searching the space of the universe of discourse. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, the historical data of Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX) are examined. The simulation result shows that the proposed model outperforms the previous forecasting models based on the highorder fuzzy time series. These results are very promising for the future work on the development of fuzzy time series and PSO algorithm in real-world forecasting applications.

   schemes; Elliptic equations
AB In this paper, we investigate a general model of boundary value problems with irregular boundary conditions, a model attracting a lot of attention from researchers all over the world [2-6]. By the two approaches of finding values of functions or derivatives on the unidentified boundary conditions, we propose two iterative schemes to define approximation solutions of the problem and compare the rate of convergence of the two iterative schemes. The performed numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the two proposed methods.

DE Keyphrase extraction; Recommendation system; Naive Bayes; E-consultance
AB In education organizations, a number of quotidian and duplicated consulting questions for training programs, university regulations... make difficulties, inconvenient and time-consuming for consultants. This work proposes a method to suggest answers of similar questions, which may help both students and consultants in orientation. This method includes two main tasks: (i) query generation which extracts key phrases from input questions, (ii) searching which find out most similar questions with their answers and relevant scores using extracted key phrases. For the first task, a check strategy was used to build key phrase candidates and the Naive Bayes Classifier was used to select key phrases. The two different approaches were experimented for the second one: (i) Similarity Comparison Searching, and (ii) Sorl Search Engine. The precision of the key phrase extraction is about 69 %. BKCA, an e- consultancy system for SoICT- HUST, was built and experimented with about 46% relevant question- answer pairs for the Similarity Comparison searching approach, and about 39% for the Sorl Search Engine one.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Human behaviour analysis helps to monitor a person's daily activities and detect home care emergencies. Classifying posture is an important step of human behaviour analysis. Many studies improve the accuracy of classifying. However, the number of features is big or extracting these features uses complicated formulas. Therefore, we proposed two features with simple computing. Two new features are formulated from the height and the square showing the human body's silhouettes. Then, we choose a non-linear Support Vector Machine to classify postures based on proposed features. Experiments show Support Vector Machine classify effectively and better than other methods.

AB Multi-robot systems (MRS) have shown clear advantages over single robots in the application of exploring unknown environments a fundamental problem in robotics. Among algorithms which are able to be applied to MRS in the application, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-a heuristic optimization technique inspired by social behavior of natural swarms -has received much attention and is well-known for its efficiency and simplicity to implement. However, when conventional PSO is applied, the problems of disconnection and collision within the system are inevitable. Two of various methods proposed to address these crucial issues are applying BOIDS and Artificial Potential Field (APF) to modify PSO. In this work, we simulated both modified algorithms on Matlab under various scenarios for analysis and comparison.

AB Determining the position of nodes of a network plays an important role in many wireless sensor networks (WSN) applications e.g. in tracking, detecting, monitoring, etc. In this paper, the multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (MGWO) for the estimating approaches of the located nodes in a network is proposed to solve the multi-objective optimization localization issues in WSNs. There two objective functions related to the estimation localization are the distance of nodes and the geometric topology that consider to formula multiobjective optimization localization. The simulation results show considerable improvements in terms of localization accuracy and convergence rate in comparison with those obtained from the other methods.

DE Adaptive fuzzy sliding mode; Model reference adaptive systems (MRAS);
   Coupled tank liquid level
AB In this paper, an Adaptive Fuzzy Sliding Mode combined with Model Reference Adaptive System (MRAS) is proposed to a single input-single output nonlinear system. The main goal of this paper is the control of second order nonlinear system. Firstly, adaptive fuzzy sliding mode is applied to design the controller. Next, a performance of system and a chattering phenomenon are improved by adjusting parameters of the controller via MRAS. Finally, an example is presented to illustrate the proposed methods. By applying Lyapunov stability theory, the adaptive law that is derived in this study is robust and convergent quickly. The simulation results and analysis show that the proposed method is better than Adaptive Fuzzy Sliding Mode in the sense of robustness against disturbance and reduce the chattering.

DE Computational trust; Tag; Interest; Topic; Social network
AB Computational trust in the social media depends both on the interaction types and on the expertise, which exposes user's interests by tags on items such as books, articles, images etc. However, when there is not any interaction among users, such a computation is impossible. In this paper, we first propose a novel model of computational trust among users in social network to incorporate the interaction among users and semantics of topics based on tags posted by users. Both types of direct and indirect interaction via intermediate ones are utilized for computation in the model. Then, we introduce algorithms for computing trust among users in social network.

AB This paper proposes two new variants of group signature protocols with and without distinguished signing authorities based on the multisignature signature scheme to reduce significantly the signature length and masking signers public keys. The proposed protocols do not include a secret sharing and knowledge proving procedure. Thus, these protocols allow a flexible modification of the group structure by the group manager. Compared to the known group signature protocols, our protocols are designed based on integrating the multisignature scheme into the group signature protocol.

ID KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY
AB The objective interestingness measures play an important role in data mining because they are used for mining, filtering and ranking the patterns. However, there is no research that collects the measures fully as well as there is no tool that can: automatically calculate the interestingness values of the patterns by using those measures, and is the framework for rapidly developing the applications related to objective interestingness measures. This paper describes Interestingnesslab - a tool of the objective interestingness measures is developed in the R language. The main functions of the tool are: mining a set of association rules and presenting them by the cardinalities (n, n(X), n(Y), n(X (Y) over bar)), calculating the interestingness value of an association rule according to 1 of 109 collected measures; calculating the interestingness values of the whole rule set in many measures selected by the user; discovering the tendencies in a data set and recommending the top N items to the user; and studying the specific behavior of a set of interestingness measures in the context of a specific dataset and in an exploratory data analysis perspective. With Interestingnesslab, the user can easily and quickly reuse its functions to develop his/her own applications.

AB Quantum neural networks (QNNs) have been explored as one of the best approach for improving the computational efficiency of neural networks. Because of the powerful and fantastic performance of quantum computation, some researchers have begun considering the implications of quantum computation on the field of artificial neural networks (ANNs). The purpose of this paper is to introduce an application of QNNs in malwares classification. Inherently Fuzzy Feedforward Neural Networks with sigmoidal hidden units was used to develop quantized representations of sample information provided by the training data set in various graded levels of certainty. Experimental results presented here show that (QNN's) gave a kind of fast and realistic results compared with the (ANN's). Simulation results indicate that QNN is superior (with total accuracy of 98.245 %) than ANN (with total accuracy of 95.214 %).

   User feedbacks
AB In this paper, we propose an efficient and flexible framework for activity recognition based on smartphone sensors, so called Mobile Online Activity Recognition System (MOARS). This system comprises data collection, training, activity recognition, and feedback monitoring. It allows users to put their smartphones in any position and at any direction. In our proposed framework, a set of power-based and frequency-based features is extracted from sensor data. Then, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithms are deployed for recognizing a set of user activities. Our framework dynamically takes into account real-time user feedbacks to increase the accuracy of activity prediction. This framework is able to apply for intelligent mobile applications. A number of experiments are carried out to show the high accuracy of MOARS in detecting user activities when walking or driving a motorbike.

DE Similar measure; Text; Entry; Social media; Feature
AB Similar measures play an important role in information processing and have been widely investigated in computer science. With the exploration of social media such as Youtube,Wikipedia, Facebook etc., a huge number of entries have been posted on these portals. They are often described by means of short text or sets of words. Discovering similar entries based on such texts has become challenges in constructing information searching or filtering engines and attracted several research interests. In this paper, we firstly introduce a model of entries posted on media or entertainment portals, which is based on their features composed of title, category, tags, and content. Then, we present a novel similar measure among entries that incorporates their features. The experimental results show the superiority of our incorporation similarity measure compared with the other ones.

AB Wireless Mobile Networks (WMNs) play a fundamental role in the activities of each individual and organization. However, they have a number of limitations about hardware resources, processing capacity of the network devices. Hence, when integrating the cipher algorithms into the devices, the algorithms will have to be sure to reach high efficiency (fast processing speed and little resource expenses). This paper will demonstrate some results of constructing a new algorithm of cipher blocks based on the controlled element F2/2. This is the controlled element which has been studied and proved to be suitable for developing the algorithms of block ciphers with highly integrated speed and efficiency on the hardware platform VLSI. Therefore, this algorithm will be sure to work effectively and suitable for transmitting secretly on WMNs. Furthermore, this paper will also propose the schedule which creates the on-the-fly key to counteract the attacks of the related key. Usage of this key schedule will still ensure high efficiency when integrating the cipher algorithms on WSNs.

ID LAPLACE EQUATION; SINGULARITIES
AB In this paper we consider a strongly mixed elliptic boundary value problem in an unbounded domain, where there is one point of transmission of boundary conditions on an unbounded boundary. By a domain decomposition technique the problem is reduced to two problems, one with weakly mixed boundary conditions in a bounded subdomain and another with the Dirichlet boundary conditions in the remaining unbounded subdomain. For the problem in the bounded subdomain the finite difference method on a uniform grid is used. Meanwhile the problem in the unbounded subdomain is discretized on a non-uniform grid and for solving the resulting system of grid equations we use the method of infinite systems, developed by ourselves recently. Numerical experiments, where the grid with the monotonically increasing grid sizes on the unbounded subdomain is used, show the efficiency of the proposed method.

AB In this paper, the outage performance and system throughput of a decode-and-forward half-duplex relay network, in which the relay node is equipped with time switching based energy harvesting capability, are derived rigorously. The analytical results provide theoretical insights into the effect of various system parameters, such as time switching factor, source transmission rate, transmitting-power-to-noise ratio to system performance. Our analysis is confirmed by Monte-Carlo simulation, and can serve as a guideline to design practical energy-harvested relaying systems.

AB An efficient technique used to prolong the lifetime of energy-constrained networks is energy harvesting (EH). In this paper, we investigate and develop the energy allocation methods for the relaying networks, in which opportunistic multiple relay selection schemes with both the full-duplex (FD)and half-duplex (HD)scheme for both EH and non-EH in decode-and-forward (DF)relaying mode. In addition, there are two policies proposed in this paper: (1) Max-Min with Self Interference Relay Selection (MMSI);(2) Max-Min Relay Selection (MMSR) are depicted for both EH and Non-EH relaying modes. Particularly, we derive closed-form expressions of outage probability to analyze the performance of systems. In addition, we propose the impact of self-interference on both policies to provide a practical insight. The results in numerical analysis reveal that the proposed MMSI scheme outperforms the MMSR mode in terms of outage probability.

AB We introduce a method for discovering new patterns in financial time series. Our method focuses on two main tasks of time series mining: Start with time series representation which helps to reduce the dimension and extracts useful feature of raw time series; Next discover on symbolic time series to find out new useful patterns which helpfully to improve trading decision in financial domain. In our work, we are interested in some patterns which have high win ratio percent (i.e. greater 70 %). In the first phrase, (i) raw data will be split into some segments with same length, (ii) local trend will be used to convert each subsequence into symbolic (U, u, s, d or D). In second phrase, we use a sliding window with size w moved on symbolic time series to create a collection of transactions. Based on this collection, the SPAM algorithm is used to discover all patterns with low minSup. In the last phrase, win/loss constraint used to discover new patterns in financial time series will be presented. Our demonstrate based on Gold Spot dataset from 2012-01-01 to 2015-01-01 is experimented.

DE Testbed; Experiment; Wireless performance
AB Today the trend of using hardware environment for testing and assessmenting (testbed) is increasingly becoming more popular. This is obvious because testing on the real equipment is always more accurate than testing on the theoretical model or software simulation. In addition, the cost of computer hardware is decreasing quite fast, and its design is getting more compact, this contributes to facilitating the use of hardware system. Therefore, testbed system is a popular trend which many research institutes in the world use widely. In Vietnam at present, researching on the performance of wireless network is a current issue and there have been many researches about this. However, most researches are only testing and evaluating the result by using methods proved by mathematics model, or based on the software simulation. Building a testbed system for wireless network is meaningful for basic researches at Vietnam Institute of Information Technology, as well as for extending more co-operations with other outside organizations.

DE Hidden markov model; Non-negative matrix factorization;
   Naturalness-intelligibility decomposition
AB Hidden Markov model (HMM)-based synthesized speech is intelligible but not natural especially under limited data condition. The goal of this study is to improve naturalness without violating acceptable intelligibility by decomposing the naturalness and intelligibility of synthesized speech using a novel asymmetric bilinear model involving non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Subjective evaluations carried out on Vietnamese data confirmed that the achieved synthesis quality is higher than other methods under limited data condition. Since F0 contour is important for naturalness and intelligibility, especially in Vietnamese. Proposed method is capable of modifying over-smoothed F0 contour without destroying tonal information.

AB The benefits and necessity of multi-core technology are undeniable and make it a critical trend in chip manufacture. This shift, however, also brings complexities in computer sciences, especially in job scheduling problem. Additionally, energy bills have been a major concern due to the increasing population of computing systems lately. The trade-off between performance and energy efficiency in such systems makes the scheduling optimization more challenging.
   This study aims to propose an energy-efficient scheduling solution that exploits the resource heterogeneity and utilization in computing clusters of multi-core processors. The numerical results show that the proposed policy helps saving significant energy in a heterogeneous cluster.

DE Software defined networking; OpenFlow network; Network security
AB Although OpenFlow network protocol is a promising network approach with many advantages compared to traditional network approaches, it still suffers from network attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for an OpenFlow-based switch with associated multiple network security techniques, so-called Secured-OFS. The proposed Secured-OFS can not only function as a switch following the OpenFlow protocol but also help protect a network against many attack types. We implement the first FPGA-based prototype version of our proposed Secured-OFS using a Xilinx Virtex 5 xc5vtx240t device. In this first prototype version, we integrate two different DDoS defense techniques, Hop-Count Filtering and Port Ingress/Egress Filtering. The experimental results show that the switch not only fulfills the OpenFlow protocol but also be able to defense against DDoS attacks. The system achieves a maximum throughput at 19.729 Gbps while a 100% DDoS attack detection rate is obtained.

AB The Fuzzy Min max Neural Network (FMNN) developed by Simpson is defined as a neural network that forms hyperboxes for classification and prediction. This paper proposes an improvement in learning algorithm in FMNN using semi-supervised clustering method, called SS-FMM. The proposed model combines the advantages of supervised learning and those of unsupervised learning. Labeled a part of data is the additional information that is used in this semi-supervised clustering method. For evaluation purpose, this algorithm is implemented on two datasets including Shape sets from CS and Thyorid disease from UCI. A part from that, in this paper, some related algorithms in FMNN are also setup on these datasets in order to compare the accuracy with proposed algorithm. The test results show that the novel algorithm has the better performance.

ID HOME AUTOMATION
AB In the recent years, the terms of "Internet of Things" and "Smart Building Automation System" come into practical implementations from a hot topic for researches and developments. Beyond the concept of facilities or appliances in an apartment or office can be controlled remotely, as an automated entity, such the system is now required to be intelligent. The intelligence include an adaptive operation with context awareness, energy efficiency, and comfort living experience. However, it is difficult to realize such the complicated systems due to a gap between a high levels of abstraction in expectations to real devices. The purpose of this work is to realize a Smart Lecture Room, from a classical campus lecture room, as a complete solution for both building managers and users. During the development, the design process for this particular system is constructed. The realized system is then be analyzed to have better improvements in the future.

   Vituarl reality glove
AB In this paper, we introduce a method of recognition numbers and special characters of Vietnam sign language. We address a development of a glove-based gesture recognition system. A sensor glove is attached ten flex sensors and one accelerometer. Flex sensors are used for sensing the curvature of fingers and the accelerometer is used in detecting a movement of a hand. Depending on the hand's postures, i.e., vertical, horizontal, and movement, sign language of numbers and special characters can be divided to group 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Firstly, the hand's posture is recognized. Next, if the hand's posture belongs to either group 1 or group 2, a matching algorithm is used to detect a number or one of special characters. If the posture belongs to group 3, a dynamic time warping algorithm is applied. The use of our system in recognizing Vietnamese sign language is illustrated. In addition, experimental results are provided.

ID LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION
AB Topic models are popular for modeling discrete data (e.g., texts, images, videos, links), and provide an efficient way to discover hidden structures/semantics in massive data. The problem of posterior inference for individual texts is particularly important in streaming environments, but often intractable in the worst case. Some existing methods for posterior inference are approximate but do not have any guarantee on neither quality nor convergence rate. Online Maximum a Posterior Estimation algorithm (OPE) [13] has more attractive properties than existing inference approaches, including theoretical guarantees on quality and fast convergence rate. In this paper, we introduce three new algorithms to improve OPE (so called OPE1, OPE2, OPE3) by using stochastic bounds when doing inference. Our algorithms not only maintain the key advantages of OPE but often outperform OPE and existing algorithms. Our new algorithms have been employed to develop new effective methods for learning topic models from massive/streaming text collections.

ID ROBOT
AB Odor source localization is a problem of great importance. Two mainstream methods among numerous proposed ones are probabilistic algorithms and bio-inspired algorithms. Compared to probabilistic algorithms, biomimetic approaches are much less intensive in term of computational cost. Thus, despite their slightly worse performance, biomimetic approaches have received much more attention. In this paper, a novel method based on a bio-inspired algorithm - Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) - is proposed for a multi-robot system (MRS). The proposed algorithm makes use of wind information and immediate odor gradient to enhance the performance of the MRS. A mechanism based on Artificial Potential Field (APF) is utilized to ensure non-collision movement of the robots. This method is tested by simulation on Matlab. Data for the test scenarios, all in large scales, are generated using Fluent. Nearly 2000 runs are carried out and the simulation results confirm the proposed algorithm's effectiveness.

DE NoC architectures; NOXIM network-on-chip
AB Network-on-Chip (NoC), an interesting paradigm, is one of the newest technologies for VLSI design. In this research, we approach the architecture, algorithms and the performance analyses of a NoC system. The highlight point of this research is implementing additional features to the embedded codes and evaluating special applications in a NoC system based on NOXIM simulator. The results indicated that in certain cases, we should know which is appropriate algorithm for implementing tasks. The evaluating a NoC's performance is an important research trend, hence this study provides one new method for doing that.

ID OPTIMUM DETECTION SCHEME
AB In this paper, a new near-optimum detection (NOD) scheme is combined with partial feedback technique for two dual-antenna relay nodes in the amplify-and-forward (AF) asynchronous cooperative relay network. The application of partial feedback in the proposed scheme not only offers to reduce a cooperative relaying process due to not using distributed close loop extended orthogonal space-time block code (DCL EO-STBC) encoder, but also improves the end-to-end signal noise ratio (SNR). Moreover, a near-optimum detection (NOD) scheme is used at the destination to remove completely the interference components induced by inter-symbol interference (ISI) among the relay nodes. The analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed scheme outperforms the previous feedback scheme in both the perfect synchronization and imperfect synchronization assumption cases.

DE Distribution systems planning; Photovoltaic
AB A two-stage model for the optimal planning of distribution systems with the presence of photovoltaic generation system (PV) is presented in this paper. The proposed model can determine the optimal sizing and time-frame of the equipment (feeders and transformer substations) in distribution systems. Therefore, the optimal displacement, sizing, technology and installation period of PV are also determined. The objective function is the life cycle costs minimizing of the planning project. The technical constraints are used to guarantee the operability of the distribution system including AC power flow, feeder and substation upgrading section, limited of nodal voltage and PV capacity. The binary variables are also employed in the model to represent the cost function of the equipment as well as the investment and upgrade decisions. The algorithm is programmed in GAMS. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model are examined in a test system.

   DATABASE; SIRT5; SETS
AB Protein Succinylation is a kind of post-translational modification (PTM) where a succinyl group is attacked to a lysine residue of a protein molecule. Recent findings have demonstrated the important role of Succinylation in not only taking part in various biological processes but also associating with many diseases. There are many practical methods to identify succinylation sites but an expensive cost and time-wasting should be considered. The lack of research in structure and characteristic of protein will limit to understand and discover significantly. Therefore, this work aims to focus on develop a bioinformatics method for investigating Succinylation site based on the amino acid composition and physicochemical properties. Various features were investigated in this study, including 20 Binary coding, amino acid composition (AAC), amino acid pair composition (AAPC), solvent-accessible surface area (ASA), amino acid substitution matrix (Blosum62), and positionspecific scoring matrix (PSSM). Evaluation by five-fold cross validation indicated that the selected features were effective in the identification of Succinylation sites. The model constructed from hybrid features, including BLOSUM62 and PSSM, yielded the best performance with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and MCC measurements of 0.66, 0.68, 0.67 and 0.32, respectively.

ID OF-TIME REPRESENTATION; MODEL
AB The timing control is necessary for determining its duration, stress, and rhythm in human speech; however, little attention has been paid to these issues when building a speech synthesis system. We have developed a talking robot, which generates human-like vocal sounds. The cerebellum is an important part of human brain organ that has a significant role in the coordination, precision, and timing of motor responses. In this study, we develop a simplified cerebellum-like spiking neural network model to control the timing function for the talking robot. The model was designed using the System Generator software in Matlab, and the timing duration of trained speech was estimated using hardware cosimulated with a field programmable gate array board (FPGA). The timing information obtained from the co-simulation, together with the output motor vector, is sent to the talking robot controller to generate a sound with a short duration. The result indicates that this model can be used for short-range timing learning of the talking robot.

DE algorithm; distributed; localized; QoS; routing
AB In providing new telecommunication services, the requisition for quality of network is more and more popular and sophisticated with high bandwidth, small value of delay time or packet loss etc. To assure the quality of network, the localized routing schemes have recently been researched as a promising alternative to the currently deployed global QoS routing schemes. Different from the traditional QoS routing algorithms which use global state information, the localized routing algorithms use local information collected from source node to make routing decisions. These localized routing algorithms can be solutions to meet the demand of telecom market in the near future.
   In this paper, we study and propose one model of localized QoS routing algorithm, which uses distributed routing type to route flows. We perform it with experiments, compare and realize the more considerable performance of this algorithm than other algorithms, which use the same conditions of simulation. From that, we imply that localized QoS routing algorithm using distributed routing works more effectively than other types of routing algorithm.

AB In this paper, the performance of radio frequency energy harvesting system with multiple power-constrained relays over Rician/Rayleigh fading channels is studied. This considered system consists of one power and information source, multiple power-constrained relays and one destination. In order to exploit the diversity advantage of cooperative network with low computational complexity, the relays apply the amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme to forward the received signal and the destination uses the selection combining (SC) scheme to receive the information. We derive the exact closed-form expressions of outage probability, throughput and average symbol error probability by using statistical characteristics of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Moreover, in order to understand the behavior of this system, we investigate the performance in various system parameters, such as energy harvesting time, relay number, and relay location. Finally, the correctness of the analytical results is confirmed by Monte-Carlo simulation.

AB Due to the the harsh communication environment in Vehicular communications, the current applications and standards in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) can be applied for safety-related message exchange but in the future world, the other new applications for autonomous controlled vehicles require more reliability and capacity with small delay. Therefore, this paper proposes a new database of radio environment and packet delivery rate (PDR) for VANETs. In addition, we propose a novel relay selection method using the new database for wireless multi-hop Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communications. The simulation results show that the proposed method achieves the significant reduction of transmission time delay with keeping the decrease in the average number of transmitted packet in network.

DE Traffic routing; ant colony system; genetic algorithm
AB The Ant Colony System (ACS) is a variant of Ant colony optimization algorithm. It is very famous with Traveling Salesman Problem. The parameters of ACS in tour construction, global and local updating pheromone direct effort to get the best result of this but they are often manually setting up. Beside, building the heuristic function to decide a choice next node on tour is potential research approach. Therefore, this paper present a foundation framework that propose a novel method to solve traffic routing problem by hybrid ant colony system (ACS) based on genetic algorithm, visualization online changing traffic light, it is called (GACSS). In the GACSS, We use genetic algorithm (GA) optimize ACS parameters aim to attain shortest trips and time with new functions helping them to update global and local pheromone. Our experiment with GACSS deploys in VANETsim with real map from open street map project, any vehicle kind and updating traffic light real-time able. Our framework gained higher results than A-Star and classical ACS algorithm. It is not only shorter length but also smaller time for trip.

DE Multi-site cloud; multi-layer visibility; topological visualization;
   physical and virtualized resources
AB Infrastructure visualization based on monitored resource status is essential for the effective operation of modern SDN (Software-Defined Networking)-enabled cloud. More specifically, collecting and visualizing visibility information about both physical & virtual (p+v) types of resources is one of key requirement for multi-site cloud operators. However, most existing visualization tools fall short in effectively providing the p+v topological visualization of multi-site cloud infrastructure. Thus, in this paper, by taking an example of OF@TEIN (OpenFlow @ Trans-Eurasian Information Network) multi-site experimental cloud, we attempt to realize visualization software to assist both developers and operators in capturing the p+v topological visualization of infrastructure resources.

DE Content Centric Networking; CCN; Caching
AB Content-centric networking (CCN) is considered to be the future Internet which moves from host-to-host model to transfer data model based on content name. Network data caching is a characteristic of CCN whose effectiveness depends on the content caching policies in the nodes. Leave copy everywhere (LCE) is the default policy in CCN which caches all content at all nodes leading to poor caching performance. Several policies have been proposed to improve the caching performance in CCN. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of caching policies in terms of caching hit ratio, time delay, and distance from consumer to caching hit content in the first node. In addition, we compare the caching policies combined with the content replacement policies when caching space at nodes is not enough room to cache new content. Our simulation model is implemented in the Abilene and Tree network models.

ID DISTRIBUTED COORDINATION FUNCTION
AB A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a network formed by a large number of sensor nodes where each node is equipped with a sensor to detect physical phenomena in our life. On the networking technique aspect, WSNs are regarded as a information gathering mean from sensor nodes to collected data node in general scenario. With the rapid utilities of applications based sensory data, WSNs based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard will become the key technology for internet of things era. Beside some interesting advantages, a WSN has to face with several challenges which affected to network performance such as throughput or energy consumption, which originated from its Medium Access Control procedure. Hence, improving performance of the IEEE 802.15.4 CSMAICA is an interested aim for both researchers and operators in recent year. For our best knowledge, several previous studies focused on back-off algorithm for enhancing the network performance are proposed but just considered to Binary exponential Back-off only. To fill the gap, we propose a novel analytical model to analyze the performance of the IEEE 802.15.4 unslotted CSMAICA employed Exponential Increase Exponential Decrease (EIED) back-off algorithm in this paper. Our model is validated by numerical results and show that the performance of EIED algorithm overcomes of BEB algorithm in term of throughput and energy consume.

   Integer Linear Programming
AB As the increasingly large amount of traffic are carried out by WDM networks and the era of information society has been clearly shaped, any network failure would cause massive impact. Operators have been therefore paying growing attention to resilience issues and indeed, guaranteeing survivability has become integral part of network design process. Among protection schemes, dedicated one stands out in terms of efficient recovery speed, ease of operation and thus, being widely deployed in practice. The significant progress in Dexible optics are inspiring new opportunities in dimensioning optical network with dedicated protection. In this context, the paper investigates the use of multi-line rate (MLR) transponder having two bit-rate options by switching the modulation format for dedicated protection purpose. A novel adaptive operation of MLR is proposed based on the protection-aware configuration. The protectionaware scheme exploits MLR transponders at lower bit-rate for working mode and adaptively tunes them to higher rate to handle temporary protection traffic in case of failure. We formulate the routing and Dow aUocation in opaque WDM network design with dedicated protection as mixed integer linear programming and propose two transponder allocation algorithms based on protection-aware operation. The benefits of our new protection proposals compared to traditional approach are quantified over extensive simulations on diverse network topologies and random traffic matrices. Encouraging results are observed with a saving of more than 30% number of transponder and promising cost and power consumption gain could be achieved in a wide range of MLR cost and power consumption assumption.

   communication
AB MCU-ru is a popular video conference system, improved from Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) open source. Users can send their video streams to MCU server and the system compresses all received video streams into one mixed multiple-view stream and sends back to all users. This method allows users with modest Internet bandwidth to video conference. Although the system works well in many countries, the quality of video conferencing can be significantly reduced when the available bandwidth is not stable, such as peak usage times. This article focuses on the improvement of the problem mentioned above by a simple approach: for a chosen codec when a client receives the mixed stream from MCU server by RTP, RTCP sends the quality feedback of the communication session to MCU server as well as in the reverse direction. As a result, both the client and server would have enough information to adjust the frame-per-second (FPS) and video resolution to optimize the usage of the available network bandwidth. We have run the system through multiple test scenarios and found that this method shows promising results in reducing bandwidth consumption. Lastly, an added feature of the design allows users to switch between mixed stream and specific stream, which gives participants of the video conferences more options.

AB This paper introduces a chaos-based security model applied at the physical layer of visible light communication (VLC) systems. The proposed model employs a Lorenz oscillator, a variation of the inverse system approach, to generate a chaotic wave to be added to the output signal before sending over a VLC channel. It consists in first encrypting only the header and second to include random padding bits. This helps to protect the IEEE 802.15.7 VLC frame from eavesdropping because hackers are unable to recognize the frame if they have no information regarding the implemented chaotic oscillator, i.e. Lorenz oscillator,, the parametric set and its coupling methodology. On the other hand, at the receiver side, the IEEE 802.15.7 frames are easily recovered by eliminating the chaotic wave by the authorized receiver based on chaotic synchronization principles. Simulation results show that the header of the IEEE 802.15.7 frame embedded into chaotic signal transmitted over a VLC channel cannot be captured by unauthorized receivers while still enabling authorized ones to perfectly recover the IEEE 802.15.7 frame.

AB In this article, a novel receiver for Ultra-wideband (UWB) communication based the emerging theory of Compressed Sensing (CS) is proposed. Our proposals focus on solving two following problems. At First, according to the concept of CS that gets from the sparsity of the most signal to attain dependable demodulation via a comparatively small number of measurements, the receiver would be designed to be fit. Generally, number of measurements is a lot less than the samples required in the original signal, that can minimize the sampling rate at the receiver and, therefore, reducing the hardware complexity of the system. Secondly, we develop an analytical framework to evaluate the impact of Inter Multipulses Interference (IMI) on high-speed data transmission of UWB communication system. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the IMI mainly depend on the channel models that are the cause of the limited data rate of the UWB communication systems. In addition, we demonstrate that, the receiver's performance can be reduced the sampling rate to less than 12.5% of Nyquist rate. Finally, to improve the BER performance, a receiver based CS with the structure of the Decision Feedback Equalization (DFE) is also presented in this article.

ID MODULATION
AB In an amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying channel, the signal from source node travels to destination node through a number of relaying nodes, in which each node forwards the received signal from the previous node to the next node. In this paper, we mathematically analyze the channel capacity of AF free-space optical (FSO) systems over atmospheric turbulence channels modeled by log-normal distribution in case of weak turbulence strength and the gamma-gamma distribution in case of moderate and strong turbulence strength. In particularly, the average channel capacity (ACC), which is expressed in terms of average spectral efficiency (ASE), is attained by changing between weak and strong turbulence conditions. A closed form expressions was also acquired for evaluating the system performance by considering the effects of different number of relay stations, turbulence strength, and link distance.

AB Routing and spectrum assignment ( RSA) problem is a crucial task in designing, planning and operating next-generation optical network based on flex-grid scheme. In practical cases, solving RSA problem involves a number of objectives which, very often, may be in conflict to each other. The need is therefore to find a pool of solutions, known as Pareto-optimal solutions, which are equally optimal. In this context, the paper focuses on the use of multi-objective genetic algorithm for finding such Pareto front in solving RSA problem with multiple objectives. Numerical results show that the algorithm could find Pareto front in an efficient time manner and indeed achieve good convergence rate.

ID HISTOGRAMS
AB A warning system about drowsy status (fatigue or drowsiness) of the driver, helping to limit the traffic accidents caused by falling asleep behind the wheel by determining the status of the eyes combined with the head direction of driver. In this paper, we present a novel approach for determining the position of a human face and eyes in different directions of the face (turning left, turning right, tilt left, tilt right, looked-up, broke-down), using ASM model. Besides, we suggested an improved algorithm to detect and identify the status of the eyes to support the driver during driving. This algorithm consists of three main steps: (1) enhance the brightness of the image area contains two eyes using color spaces and median filter processing; (2) the image area contains two eye was extracted by a method of morphologies and image segmentation with dynamic threshold; (3) finally, the status of the eyes is determined by using SVM classifier based on HOG feature. Next, the direction of the driver's head is estimated by combining the 3D head model and algorithms posit to increase the effectiveness of the warning system. Our tested is performed with the data which was set by our (3778 photos of eyes of 9 people). Testing accuracy achieved is 97.86% and the average recognition time is 0.106s/image frame. Testing accuracy confirms the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed system.

DE Ultra-Wideband; Pre-coding filter; sampling rate; compressed sensing
AB In this paper, a novel transceiver for the UltraWideband (UWB) communication based on emerging theory of compressed sensing (CS) is exploited. The proposed approach of this article is to apply the CS theory for UWB communication to solve the bottleneck of the sampling at the receiver. CS appears to be a natural solution to solve this problem. Our major contribution is to exploit the sparsity of the transmitted image and the channel itself as a part of CS measurement process. According to this basis, in the receiver, the sampling rate will decrease more than traditional sampling systems, and hence, simplify of analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Extensive simulation show that the proposed model can successfully recover original images with the number of samples required less than 10% of Nyquist rate. Finally, in the case of taking into of impact of noise, BER performance of the proposed model compared to the traditional model are also presented in this paper.

DE camera calibration; size estimation; perspective distortion; partial
   occlusion; binary image processing
AB Distortions, such as perspective distortion and partial occlusion, causes objects in different locations in the image of a scene appear to have different sizes. We present a new camera calibration method for estimating the dimension of objects, particularly people, in several locations in the image of a scene. Segmentation methods such as background subtraction combined with frame differencing is used to separate background regions from foreground regions, which correspond to transient objects in the scene such as persons. Horizontal runlength features are computed from the binary images of the foreground regions. A feature distribution of the run-length features is accumulated over a certain learning period and maintained for each location in the image. From the feature distributions, object dimensions in each image location are then estimated and expressed as average object width and estimated height. Even with partial occlusion, such as persons behind and aisle, person size estimation works quite well. This calibration method will benefit methods for object detection, robust object tracking, location-specific image filtering, location-specific morphological filtering and estimation of perspective distortion.

AB Business process models have been used in a lot of enterprise applications. Along with their popularity, the problem of how to create them correctly in terms of semantics and syntax while effectively promoting the reuse of suitable parts of existing models is increasingly interest. This paper describes how to organize a knowledge base to facilitate the shareability and reusability of business workflow templates. We first introduce a repository consisting of business workflow templates which are well-checked at the syntactic and semantic level. An organizational mechanism for control flow-based business workflow templates is therefore provided to ensure an effective search of templates. We then propose a process for developing workflow templates. Thereby for each use case, users can select and modify suitable workflow templates from the knowledge base.

AB Short reverse recovery time of a p-n junction is critical for high speed semiconductor device operation. This time period is a result of recombination processes when a p-n junction is switched from forward bias to reverse bias. Minority carrier lifetime is the major parameter determining the duration of reverse recovery. Three main poly-types of Silicon Carbide (SiC) including 4H-SiC, 6H-SiC and 3C-SiC were examined. Vanadium impurity defects in three SiC poly-types are considered with fixed capture cross section and defect density. Vanadium has deep level defect states in SiC and as such is active as a recombination center. The study finds that reverse recovery time depend not only on the ratio between the magnitude of forward and reverse current, but also on temperature and the comparison between forward voltage versus the gap between the impurity level and the middle of band gap.

AB Compared to its synchronous counterpart, asynchronous design potentially provides many advantages in terms of power consumption, execution speed, and circuit reliability. This paper presents and discusses a complete new asynchronous circuit design flow of an 8-point Fast Fourier Transform circuit, a common building block in digital signal processing applications, starting from the radix-2 8-point decimation-in-time Fast Fourier Transform algorithm development to the final asynchronous gate netlist implementation and verification. The asynchronous hardware implementation is based on Null Convention Logic design methodology, a Quasi-Delay-Insensitive asynchronous design paradigm that has accomplished important advancements in recent years. The coarse-grained Null Convention Logic based 8-point Fast Fourier Transform circuit, implemented in a built-in commercial 65 nanometers process cell library, is functionally correct compared to its synchronous equivalent and can work at the maximum frequency of 8 Megahertz.

AB Power electronics and electrical machines nowadays offer an extremely wide range of industrial applications. Their modeling and simulation are also a great interest to engineers and scientists. In some simulation applications, nonlinear of the power electronic devices is neglected due to its simplicity. Therefore, the performance of the control system obtained is not the same as experimental results. In this paper, a model of two-level three-phase voltage source inverter having its voltage drops is proposed. The proposed inverter was tested with RL load using space vector pulse width modulation and direct torque control of three-phase induction motors. The simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed work.

DE Merging Management; Merging Control; Personal Rapid Transit
AB In this research, a smart transportation system integrated with a management system of highly distributed communication network for Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) was designed. The Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) system is a new and easy-to-use transportation solution for 1-4 persons to destination directly. PRT system offers great potential for becoming a common transportation system in the future involving driverless vehicles, ride comfort and collision warning with low construction cost and operation cost. In PRT system, two important functions are automatic driverless control and crossway merging control. To have safe and smooth merging operation in automated vehicle systems for PRT, a merging management system is necessary. Our work proposed a new merging management system related to distributed traffic control, new locating method and safe dynamic headway. In this system, an efficient car communication was built based on the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) wireless protocol and highly distributed control. In order to determine the car location, RFID technique is used in the system. A new buffer-zone strategy and fuzzy logic control are two efficient vehicle-merging algorithms that are required for dynamic determination of the merging sequence for all cars in a Y-intersection. From simulation results, it was found that cruise distance can be safely kept from each car to its front car and each car can merge into mainline smoothly gently and efficiently.

AB Nowadays, most coastal regions face a potential risk of tsunami. The evacuation is one of the most effective mitigation procedures. Howerver, there are always the part of evacuees (e.g. the tourist) who lack information of the evacuation map, which motivates us to focus on the problem of optimizing of guidance sign placement for tsunami evacuation. Concretely, we must find out an optimal sign placement in order to have as many evacuees as possible to reach shelters before tsunami arrival.
   In fact, most studies focus on two approaches: Agent-Based modeling and Equation-Based modeling. Each approach has its own pros and cons. While the Agent-Based modeling introduces an accurate but very slow model, the Equation-Based one provides a very fast but inaccurate model. The idea of this study is that we learn the accurate Agent-Based model and adapt it into very fast Equation-Based model in order to solve the optimizing problem.
   In this paper, we present clearly two models representing the two approaches and pros and cons of each model. We then propose a reinforcement learning approach for adapting complex Agent-Based model into a very fast Linear Model (representing Equation-Based modeling approach). By experimentation, our proposed approach shows that we can replace a slow complex model by a very fast model with an acceptable level of accuracy in order to solve optimizing problem.

AB In this paper, based on hedge algebras approach, we focus on the relationship subclass - superclass of fuzzy object oriented database. based on the semantic approximation of the two fuzzy data, we identify the subtle class and build methods calculate quantitatively the fuzzy hierarchical in the relationships between subclass and superclass. Besides, multiple inheritance is a fairly complex problem when we study fuzzy object-oriented database models, so we also have launched plans to overcome the difficulties in the multiple inheritance of the class.

AB The development of technology has a huge impact on people life. Specifically, it changes the way how things are stored and transmitted. Lots of information are put on the Internet or in local storage instead of printed or written on papers so that they can be easily looked up and processed. The amount of electronic data grows very fast and they exist in plenty of structures and contents, which lead to the need of efficient ways handling such a huge data volume. In this context, document modeling methods become crucial. Those methods give a common representation for different document structures and make it easy to extract information from the collection. This paper proposes an efficient document modeling framework that can be applied in real-world applications, such as search engines and web recommendation systems. The framework adopts vector space models and topic models with some modified factors to transform documents before modeling and improve the efficiency.

AB Human gesture recognition is a rather new field and many challenges, sign language recognition is a concrete example of gesture recognition. In this paper, we study the feasibility and effectiveness of vector machine learning methods, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Simplification of Support Vector Machine (SimpSVM) and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) to the sign language recognition problem. At the same time, we also give some comparative results of SVM, SimpSVM and RVM for that problem. The experimental results on the Auslan data set show SVM, SimpSVM and RVM could achieve the state-of-the- art predictive performance, also pointed out that prediction behaviors of them are similar in terms of the prediction accuracy when the number of feature changed and sign discrimination. However, SimpSVM and RVM require fewer testing time than SVM in testing phase.

AB A sense tagged corpus is important resources to word sense disambiguation and word sense identification. However, the sense tagging process should be conducted manually that it is a time consuming and expensive process. Therefore, the semi-automatic construction of sense tagged corpora is studied to reduce the cost of word sense tagging. This construction should contain two important phases that are word sense recommendation, which is done automatically, and word sense correction, which is done manually. This paper aims at word sense recommendation phase and presents the method of automatically identifying word sense with Wordnet senses using semantic vector. To evaluate the method, a component implementing word sense recommendation phase with latent semantic index, and then with word vector estimation, is tested with Wordnet and SemCor version 3.0 corpus.

AB Scalability is an important requirement in the development and the operation of applications in a cloud environment. To handling heavy concurrency in the input load, many design-related and operational factors should be considered. The microservice architecture patterns provide better means to increase the scalability than traditional software architecture patterns. However, certain aspects of applications such as the need to persist/maintain the application state require additional measures in the design and the supporting mechanism. We propose a scalable routing mechanism for applications designed according to the microservice architecture. In particular, a cloud infrastructure resource reservation application has been designed with some stateful services. The proposed approach maintains a good scalability, which provides a mean to achieve the efficient usage of the infrastructure resources.

AB A coreference refers to different instances of the same real-world entity. Coreference classification is an important problem in knowledge and data management. The basic idea is to predict whether two instances are matched or non-matched, based on their similarity vector. Previous efforts on coreference classification share a common weakness. It is the unawareness of the ambiguity variation among different clusters of instance-pairs. We discuss the importance of cluster wise instance-pairs local ranking, which is an effective solution for the ambiguity variation. Since then, we study the inclusive possibility of the ranking factor in a classifier globally trained from all clusters. Finally, we propose to include an extra element in the original similarity vector of the instance pairs. Such extra element is a ranking-aware feature, which represents the preference of an instance-pair against its cluster. The experiment results confirm that the proposed feature significantly boosts the performance of many classifiers.

AB In this work, the implementation of a chaotic oscillator by using a microcontroller is proposed. The dynamical system, which is used, belongs to the recently new proposed category of dynamical systems with hidden attractors. In more details, the system has an infinite number of equilibrium points which is located on an open hyperbolic sine curve. By programming the microcontroller, the three most useful tools of nonlinear theory, the phase portrait, the Poincare map and the bifurcation diagram can be produced. The comparison of these with the respective simulation results, which are produced by solving the continuous dynamical system with Runge-Kutta, verified the feasibility of the proposed method.

AB By analyzing the issue of chaos synchronization in the literature, it can be noticed the lack of a general approach, which would enable any type of synchronization to be achieved. Similarly, there is the lack of a unified method for synchronizing both continuous-time and discrete-time systems via a scalar signal. This paper and the companion one [1] aim to bridge these two gaps by presenting a novel general unified framework to synchronize chaotic systems via a scalar signal. The framework, based on the concept of observer, enables any type of synchronization defined to date to be achieved for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems via a scalar signal. This paper focuses on continuous-time systems, while the companion paper [1] deals with discrete-time systems. Herein, the observer-based framework exploits a structural condition related to the uncontrollable eigenvalues of the error system. Several examples of different types of synchronization are illustrated, with the aim to show the capabilities of the approach.

AB In this paper, the analysis, design and circuit synthesis of a fractional-order form of a chaotic jerk system is presented. The proposed system is one of the simplest member of the jerk system's family, because it has the least number of terms, one of which is the unique nonlinear term of the system. For the first time, the hyperbolic sine term is used as a nonlinear term in this kind of jerk systems, which can be easily realized with two antiparallel diodes. Simulation results by using phase portraits and Lyapunov exponents confirm the expected system's chaotic behavior. Moreover, the electronic circuit for the evaluation of the theoretical model of the proposed fractional-order system is presented.

AB In this paper we propose the first steps for building a Vietnamese water puppetry ontology. The creation of the puppetry ontology would allow not only a more informed and productive professional training, but also the capability of preserving and promoting water puppetry. Gathering water puppetry expert knowledge requires a deep study of puppetry history, background knowledge and performance. Hence, we analyze stories, background knowledge and performance of the water puppetry in the context of the Vietnamese general culture and legends. Especially, we emphasize on the issue of inconsistencies - a key challenge in ontology building. We also present a specific case study using DL-Lite for representation, reasoning and querying in presence of inconsistencies.

AB Multi-mode fast Fourier Transform (FFT) circuits are essential in orthogonal frequency domain (OFDM) based systems which supports multiple bandwidth. Typically, hardware implementation employs a single FFT circuit for the highest supported bandwidth and using oversampling, the same FFT circuit is used to support lower bandwidth. For the new 802.11ax wireless local area network (WLAN) standard whose frame consists of the regular 3.2us length symbol as well as a longer 12.8us symbol, a fast switchable double-mode FFT circuit is required. In addition, the 802.11ax SIG-B symbol contains a maximum of two independent symbol streams that requires two FFT circuits for the 3.2us symbol length. Our proposed FFT architecture is optimized to support the 802.11ax standard with low latency, area and power requirements. FPGA implementation results show that our proposed circuit has efficiency 13.7% lower area compared to conventional architecture.

AB Reliable broadcasting data to multiple receivers over lossy wireless channels is challenging due to the heterogeneity of the wireless link conditions. Automatic Repeat-reQuest (ARQ) based retransmission schemes are bandwidth inefficient due to data duplication at receivers. Network coding (NC) has been shown to be a promising technique for improving network bandwidth efficiency by combining multiple lost data packets for retransmission. However, it is challenging to accurately determine which lost packets should be combined together due to disrupted feedback channels. This paper proposes an adaptive data encoding scheme at the transmitter by joining network coding and machine learning (NCML) for retransmission of lost packets. Our proposed NCML extracts the important features from historical feedback signals received by the transmitter to train a classifier. The constructed classifier is then used to predict states of transmitted data packets at different receivers based on their corrupted feedback signals for effective data mixing. We have conducted extensive simulations to collaborate the efficiency of our proposed approach. The simulation results show that our machine learning algorithm can be trained efficiently and accurately. The simulation results show that on average the proposed NCML can correctly classify 90% of the states of transmitted data packets at different receivers. It achieves significant bandwidth gain compared with the ARQ and NC based schemes in different transmission terrains, power levels, and the distances between the transmitter and receivers.

AB The low-velocity impact response of a precompressed circular isotropic elastic plate is investigated in the case when the dynamic behavior of the plate is described by equations taking the rotary inertia and transverse shear deformations into account. Contact interaction between the rigid impactor and the target is modeled by a generalized Hertz contact force, since it is assumed that the viscoelastic features of the plate represent themselves only in the place of contact and are governed by the standard linear solid model with fractional derivatives due to the fact that during the impact process decrosslinking occurs within the domain of the contact of the plate with the sphere, resulting in more free displacements of molecules with respect to each other, and finally in the decrease of the plate material viscosity in the contact zone.

ID ITEMSETS; STRATEGY
AB In this paper, an efficient algorithm with three pruning strategies are presented to provide tighter upper-bound average-utility of the itemsets, thus reducing the search space for mining the set of high average-utility itemsets (HAUIs). The first strategy finds the relationships of the 2-itemsets, thus reducing the search space of k-itemsets (k >= 3). The second and the third pruning strategies set lower upper-bounds of the itemsets to early reduce the unpromising candidates. Substantial experiments show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently and effectively reduce the search space compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of runtime and number of candidates.

AB The parallel processing plays an important role in efficient and effective computations of function optimization. This paper proposes a parallel optimization algorithm for the committed generating electric powers of thermal plants based on Firefly Algorithm (FA). An economic condition for the power systems can be determined through the optimization techniques for transmission loss, power balance and generation capacity. The aim of the proposed parallel algorithm with communication strategies is to correlate agents in subgroups and to share the computation load over several machines. The expense criteria for each generation unit and the coefficient matrix are formulated as the objective function, which is to be computed in our parallel optimization for electricity flow of the transmission losses in the power systems. Four selected functions and two cases of six units and fifteen units of thermal plants are tested in our experiments for optimization. Through a comparison between different methods in related works, our experimental results show that the proposed method results in the higher effect and accuracy.

ID DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION
AB Unwanted convergence to a local optimum, rather than global optimum, is possible to take place in practical multimodal optimization problems. Communication between artificial agents in the stochastic algorithms is one of the solutions to this issue. This paper proposes a novel parallel optimization algorithm, namely FDA,based on the communication of the pollen in Flower pollination algorithm (FPA) with the agents in Differential evolution algorithm (DEA) to solve the optimization problems. A communication strategy for Pollens and Agents is to take advantages of the strength points of each algorithm to explore and exploit the diversity solutions in avoiding of dropping to a local optimum. A set of benchmark functions is used to test the quality performance of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm increases the accuracy more than the existing algorithms.

AB In the inevitable trends of the modern aerial equipment, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is one of the most concerned components to research. This paper presents a saving memory optimization algorithm of Compact artificial bee colony (cABC) for UAVs route planning problem. In the proposed method, route length and danger exposure are modeled mathematically as the objective function, and the compact algorithm concept is implemented to accommodate the route planning situation. In the compact algorithm, actual design variable of solutions search space of artificial bee colony algorithm is replaced with a probabilistic representation of the population. A probabilistic representation random of the collection behavior of bees is inspired to employ for this proposed algorithm. The real population is replaced with the probability vector updated based on single competition. The computational results compared with other algorithms in the literature shows that the proposed method can provide the effective way of using a modest memory for UAV route planning problem.

ID CONGESTION
AB Due to the complex environmental constraints in the field of transport and logistics, optimization for the vehicle fuel consumption problem satisfies not only one criterion but also several criteria. In this paper, a novel multi-objective method for an optimal vehicle traveling based on Whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is proposed. In the proposed method, two criteria of distance and path-travel gasoline of the vehicle traveling issue are transformed into a minimization one. The vehicle routing and traffic status in the environmental transportation are considered to model the fitness function for the solution in WOA. The path of the globally best whale in each iteration is selected, and reached by the vehicles in sequence. In addition, the information of traffic status updates to vehicle periodically times from traffic navigation system during the traveling. Series scenarios of simulations are implemented in different traffic environments for the optimal paths when the vehicles reached the destination. The results show that the proposed method provides the confirm the practicality of the model of transport and logistics, and this proposed method may be the alternative method of optimization for the vehicle traveling in the logistics.

AB Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been recently used for various applications. Due to the distributed and (often) unattended nature of the nodes after deployment, the lack of energy and the interruptive process in each sensor are the two major problems of WSN systems. Hence, designing a protocol which not only improves system performance but also lowers sensors' energy consumption so as to maximize the network lifetime is very much desirable. The network lifetime maximization problem was known to be NP-Hard. This paper addresses the Minimum Energy-Multicasting (MEM) problem in Duty-Cycle Wireless Sensor Networks (DC-WSNs) in which sensors cyclically switch between on/off (wake/sleep) modes. To that end, we propose a local search algorithm and compare its performance with the best algorithm so far called GS-MEM over the four datasets designated for the MEM problem. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms GS-MEM in terms of energy cost.

ID MISSING DATA
AB Missing values are a common issue in many real-world datasets, and therefore coping with such datasets is an essential requirement of classification since inadequate treatment of missing values often leads to large classification errors. One of the most popular ways to address incomplete data is to use imputation methods to fill missing fields with plausible values. Multiple imputation, which fills each missing field with a set of plausible values, is a powerful approach to dealing with incomplete data, but is mainly used for statistical analysis. Ensemble learning which constructs a set of classifiers instead of one classifier has proven capable of improving classification accuracy, but has been mainly applied to complete data. This paper proposes a combination of multiple imputation and ensemble learning to build an ensemble of classifiers for incomplete data classification tasks. A multiple imputation method is used to generate a set of diverse imputed datasets which is then used to build a set of diverse classifiers. Experiments on ten benchmark datasets use a decision tree as classification algorithm and compare the proposed approach with two other popular approaches to dealing with incomplete data. The results show that, in almost all cases, the proposed method achieves significantly better classification accuracy than the other methods.

AB In this paper, general mathematical model with relevant factors to investigate the magneto mechanical coupling in magnetic core are considered. Experimental measurements of vibration and audible noise in amorphous steel cores of the transformer have been carried out. The results of the mathematical model were compared to the results of simulation by finite element method (FEM) of the previous research and experimental measurements. Magnetostrictive noise and vibration levels in the amorphous steel core have been identified higher than silicon steel core. Experimental results have shown the use of iron clamps on the leg and yoke with a reasonable clamping force permits a reduction in vibration amplitude and noise.

AB Minutiae based matching, the most popular approach used in fingerprint matching algorithms, is to calculate the similarity by finding the maximum number of matched minutiae pairs in two given fingerprints. With no prior knowledge about anchor/clue to match, this becomes a combinatorial problem. Global features of the fingerprints (e.g., singular core and delta points) can be used as the anchor to speed up the matching process. Most approaches use the conventional Poincare Index method with additional techniques to improve the detection of the core and delta points. Our approach uses Convolution Neural Networks which gained state-of-the-art results in many computer vision tasks to automatically detect those points. With the experimental results on FVC2002 database, we achieved the accuracy and false alarm of (96%, 7.5%) and (90%, 6%) for detecting core, and delta points, correspondingly. These results are comparative to those of the detection algorithms with human knowledge.

AB Full-duplex (ED) systems have emerged as an essential enabling technology to further increase the data rate of wireless communication systems. The key idea of ED is to serve multiple users over the same bandwidth with a base station (BS) that can simultaneously transmit and receive the signals. The most challenging issue in designing an ED system is to address both the harmful effects of residual self-interference caused by the transmit-to-receive antennas at the BS as well as the co-channel interference from an uplink user (ULU) to a downlink user (DLU). An efficient solution to these problems is to assign the ULUs/DLUs in different groups/slots, with each user served in multiple groups. Hence, this paper studies the joint design of transmit beamformers, ULUs/DLUs group assignment, and time allocation for each group. The specific aim is to maximize the sum rate under the ULU/DLU minimum throughput constraints. The utility function of interest is a difficult nonconcave problem, and the involved constraints are also nonconvex, and so this is a computationally troublesome problem. To solve this optimization problem, we propose a new path-following algorithm for computational solutions to arrive at least the local optima. Each iteration involves only a simple convex quadratic program. We prove that the proposed algorithm iteratively improves the objective while guaranteeing convergence. Simulation results confirm the fast convergence of the proposed algorithm with substantial performance improvements over existing approaches.

AB In this paper, we study the secrecy performance of a half-duplex cognitive relay network in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers and multiple primary users. In particular, generic Kth best relay selection schemes for opportunistic relay selection (ORS) and partial relay selection (PRS) are proposed. Exact closed form and asymptotic expressions for secrecy outage probability (SOP) of the considered schemes are derived. The outcome shows that ORS is able to achieve full secrecy diversity order while PRS obtains unit diversity order. Besides, the order of the selected relay is proved to affect the secrecy diversity order in the ORS scheme but not the PRS scheme, while the number of primary users does not have influence on the diversity order. Additionally, the significance of the change in the number of relays on the SOP enhances at higher orders of selected relay. Nevertheless, increasing the number of eavesdroppers reduces the secrecy diversity gain of the considered system in both schemes.

AB This article modifies two internal validity measures and applies them to evaluate the quality of clustering for probability density functions (pdfs). Based on these measures, we propose a new modified genetic algorithm called GA-CDF to establish the suitable clusters for pdfs. The proposed algorithm is tested by four numerical examples including two synthetic data sets and two real data sets. These examples illustrate the superiority of proposed algorithm over some existing algorithms in evaluating the internal or external validity measures. It demonstrates the feasibility and applicability of the GA-CDF for practical problems in data mining.

AB Renewable resources have added additional uncertainty to power grids. Deterministic power flow does not provide sufficient information for power system calculation and analysis, since all sources of uncertainty are not taken into account. To handle uncertainties PPF has been introduced and used as an efficient tool. In this paper, we present a cumulant-based PPF approach that can account for various sources of uncertainty in power systems with renewable resources such as wind and photovoltaic energy. We also propose the use of a new methodology to estimate probability distribution for wind power output based on measured data. The proposed approach is carried out on a modified IEEE-14 bus test system. Simulation results of the proposed method are then compared with the result obtained by Monte Carlo simulation.

AB The Android operating system has a large market share. The number of new malware on Android is increasing much recently. Android malware analysis includes static analysis and dynamic analysis. Limitations of static analysis are the difficulty in analyzing the malware using encryption techniques, to confuse the source, and to change behavior itself. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid analysis method, named NeSeDroid. This method used static analysis to detect the sensitive resource accessing. It also used dynamic analysis to detect sensitive resource leakage, through Internet connection. The method is tested on the list of applications which are downloaded from Android Apps Market, Genome Malware Project dataset and our additional samples in DroidBench dataset. The evaluation results show that the NeSeDroid has the high accuracy and it reduces the rate of fail positive detection.

TI The Performance Evaluation of an IEEE 802.11 Network Containing
   Misbehavior Nodes under Different Backoff Algorithms
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS

DT Article
ID DISTRIBUTED COORDINATION FUNCTION
AB Security of any wireless network is always an important issue due to its serious impacts on network performance. Practically, the IEEE 802.11 medium access control can be violated by several native or smart attacks that result in downgrading network performance. In recent years, there are several studies using analytical model to analyze medium access control (MAC) layer misbehavior issue to explore this problem but they have focused on binary exponential backoff only. Moreover, a practical condition such as the freezing backoff issue is not included in the previous models. Hence, this paper presents a novel analytical model of the IEEE 802.11 MAC to thoroughly understand impacts of misbehaving node on network throughput and delay parameters. Particularly, the model can express detailed backoff algorithms so that the evaluation of the network performance under some typical attacks through numerical simulation results would be easy.

AB This study investigates an adaptive-weighted instanced-based learning, for the prediction of the ultimate punching shear capacity (UPSC) of fiber-reinforced polymer-(FRP-) reinforced slabs. The concept of the new method is to employ the Differential Evolution to construct an adaptive instance-based regression model. The performance of the proposed model is compared to those of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and traditional formula-based methods. A dataset which contains the testing results of FRP-reinforced concrete slabs has been collected to establish and verify new approach. This study shows that the investigated instance-based regression model is capable of delivering the prediction result which is far more accurate than traditional formulas and very competitive with the black-box approach of ANN. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive-weighted instanced-based learning provides a means for quantifying the relevancy of each factor used for the prediction of UPSC of FRP-reinforced slabs.
